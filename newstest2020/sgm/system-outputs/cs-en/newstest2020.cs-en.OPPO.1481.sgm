<seg id="1">An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature documentary film</seg>
<seg id="2">This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will be released in Czech cinemas next spring.</seg>
<seg id="3">"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I did not hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has lasted more than half a century in the spotlight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the call to make a feature documentary film about Karel Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first day of shooting took place on 22 October last year and the last footage with Karel Gott was shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his fans, as a painter, but also as a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy with his songs to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.</seg>
<seg id="5">The film is not meant to be a showcase of the undisputed fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Phenomenon Gott with this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them at a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this will be very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed to all of us the legend with which we have the opportunity to work and spend time, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.</seg>
<seg id="6">The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott, the film will be completely authentic and unique.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Olga has a great gift for shooting with her close team so that we often got carried away with the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics that were quite intimate. She and her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated the jubilee of my life. But because I still had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot for as long as possible. Well, since there were a lot of me in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas next spring. This documentary film is a thank you to my fans and to all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," Karel Gott himself said about the film.</seg>

<seg id="1">Insects are up to 60 times smaller than 40 years ago</seg>
<seg id="2">No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species account for more than half of life on Earth. However, there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject was published just this week and the situation is even more serious than humanity previously realized.</seg>
<seg id="3">The study is based on a field survey in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they wrote at the beginning of the report, insects are now "ten to sixty times fewer" in the forest. This is a decline in the entire population, not in the number of species, and the research involved not only insects but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that depend on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authors of the research link their conclusions directly to climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report was the subject of a major article in the Washington Post on Monday, which headlines the new findings as hyper-larming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the paper, citing him as an independent expert.</seg>
<seg id="6">The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of the order of magnitude," says Lukáš Čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, besides climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "In our country, it only runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1">Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO</seg>
<seg id="2">An undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies joined in.</seg>
<seg id="3">If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich agreement and then faced a German attack, what would have taken the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? It might not have been either of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - due to blisters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The president of the Independent Union of Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. This was announced on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will continue to be president of the union for two months. He will remain in the police force after leaving the head of the union.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I can confirm that this week I handed over to the Bureau my written resignation, after which I will continue to hold full office for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I decided as a free man who does not want to be tied to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. For example, in 2011, it got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.</seg>

<seg id="1">The museum in Semilech returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition</seg>
<seg id="2">An imitation of a normalisation room with a television showing footage of the brutal crackdown by police officers on students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. It is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semilech, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semilech after the events on the National Avenue," said Tomáš Chvátal, curator of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semilech on 22 November, and then every day more people gradually packed in," he said. Among the most active were initially a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the surrounding area to sign Charter 77, and Mr and Mrs Dědečková, who were distributing the petition Several Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created quite quickly. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.</seg>
<seg id="4">Visitors should be drawn to what happened in the city at the time by about 50 photographs, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. There was also a video of the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, which will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Voice also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Seminole Archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition at the time. "They said: Let's not get drunk on a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example in December, people decided in an all-Seminole vote that the square would be Riegro's and cancelled the previous name Gottwald.</seg>
<seg id="5">The exhibition also captures the events before the events in November. "In the first part, we present to the old-timers and students what happened before, such a late normalisation. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the museum of the labour movement at the time," said Chvátal. One room is meant to give a feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The last part of the exhibition focuses on what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who experienced it will remember over the posters With Us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with the beautiful motto Everybody for their community," added the curator.</seg>

<seg id="1">Let the fans be positive, wishes Hašek. Sparta faces a showdown in Pilsen</seg>
<seg id="2">"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed, so that we can manage the match both in terms of games and results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club television.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the week, the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2: 1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She was relieved, but the game continues to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.</seg>
<seg id="5">"But it is still Sparta, which has very good players. We have a difficult game ahead of us," warns Roman Procházka.</seg>
<seg id="6">The last time the Spartans arrived in Štruncová sady, in mid-May it was a definite affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a mindless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the gap between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, Sparta is now nine points behind after ten matches of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst entries into the season ever.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is not an easy situation either for us or for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," feels Hašek. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."</seg>
<seg id="9">Sparta does not know if she will be able to use Tetteh in Plzeň, who received a two-match penalty for his suspension in Plzeň but appealed against it on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain in the numerous sickbay.</seg>
<seg id="11">The home side, who have won their last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák and, as captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan outcast.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Frightening result of study." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think</seg>
<seg id="2">1,200 respondents were interviewed, and the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nearly 60 percent of the Austrian population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on building mosques. 80 percent are in favor of greater monitoring of Islam's centers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms granted to Muslims are at risk of narrowing."</seg>
<seg id="6">For believers, the critical stance is less pronounced. Aschauer says that in Austria, it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university degree or seniors over the age of 75, while the most welcoming are Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of roughly 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion and should be decided by the end of September.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the deputy chairman of the Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, Jan Pope, there are three options for possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but it cannot be predicted, will be up to the German owner," he told ČTK today.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the two prematurely terminated trips, the TA also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pocket, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The TA has promised to pay its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security to do so.</seg>
<seg id="5">The problems in the hotels arose mainly in Majorca, where the company also asked for help from the Czech consulate. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases in which the hotel there fired all tourists from the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German company and who belongs to the Czech company. He therefore threw everyone out of the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to 995 million crowns last year, up nearly 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the financial year from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million crowns to 15.3 million crowns. From previous years, however, the company still had an outstanding loss of nearly 103 million crowns. The branch includes two basic divisions - besides CK Neckermann, it is also Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.</seg>

<seg id="2">U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking permits for Chinese firms to trade on stock markets in the United States, an informed source told Reuters today, a move that would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Shares of the firms in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down on the news, dragging down the entire market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The withdrawal of shares would be part of a broader effort to curb US investment in China, the source added, confirming a Bloomberg report that had sent financial markets into shock shortly before. Shares in Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were down between two and four percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to government data from February, 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE stock exchanges, including at least 11 state-owned enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been worked out to ensure the withdrawal of shares in Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="6">China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has had negative effects on the world economy and is raising fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China are expected to resume on October 10, with the aim of ending the trade war.</seg>

<seg id="2">Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over contracts for promotion. Pangrác confirmed to SeznamNews that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers were examining contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, some of the money was going back to Pangrác, the server reports. In the case, criminals were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose department CzechTourism belongs to. The investigation in the case is continuing, according to the server.</seg>
<seg id="3">Detectives from the National Centre against Organised Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the agency Sport Invest. They also took the service computer from the Minister's apartment. The court order for the search of the home of Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that the Minister decided in 2016, when she was deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of the chosen persons through mediation and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not err, she could document everything and she was fully cooperating with the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the agency, it was an individual error. The media had previously reported that he was the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed because of the results of the audit. This showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Yes, they accused me, but I don't want to say any more," Pangrác told the North News List.</seg>

<seg id="2">The renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he won it. He plans to sue the publisher of the red guide to get the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also questions the competence of Michelin inspectors, who he said mistook saffron for cheddar. The first court hearing is due in November.</seg>
<seg id="3">The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin because he said the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. Moreover, he said, the withdrawal of the star took place without any notice. "I have been depressed for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?" Veyrat told the commissioners.</seg>
<seg id="4">Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I work with Savoy ingredients with love," he said, objecting to Veyrat's decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who only cause controversy for commercial reasons." An indignant Veyrat does not understand "how they could afford to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé." "They also insulted our region, my employees were mad about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The prominent chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners and is therefore calling for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the business remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he does not yet have a meaningful accusation and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat is communicating with us roughly, but we will examine his comments carefully," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.</seg>

According to initial reports, however, all of this was not enough for a good film.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself does not have the character to highlight it," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.</seg>

<seg id="2">Children's accounts are provided free of charge by banks. However, the offer needs to be considered because some other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the forgiven fees to be returned to them one day. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Small accounts," she said, can do almost anything that adult accounts can do. A child gets his or her own credit card, can enter payments, track account movements, has his or her own electronic banking somewhere. Banks set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to use them and also to check their payments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Quite flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and the like. Above all, however, they can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the internet or by means of an information SMS. Beware, these may no longer be free," adds Kuncová, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."</seg>

<seg id="1">Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused him! He ended up in an institution</seg>
<seg id="2">It was nerve-racking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every now and then. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as punishment," Lucie said in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Besides the cameras, he said he had to suffer like this on a wooden mat to massage his feet! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and told me - aunt, I am making these troubles and notes just so that I am not here because I want to go to an institution," Lucie said, describing the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the door of the studio. And the boy's wish finally came true...</seg>
<seg id="3">His condition was so serious that he was taken from his family after filming and placed in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me to her Facebook page, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I hardly reacted to that at all. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in an institution, that after that he was returned to them, now he is in a diagnostic hospital. They are both out of work," says Lucie's mother from Pilsen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lightning, of course, reached out to the other side, but received only a vague reply. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," said Aneta, hanging up the phone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berlin responds to public pressure and tackles housing crisis by buying 6,000 flats from private company</seg>
<seg id="2">Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units from private Luxembourg-based ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros ($23.8 billion), which the city sold 15 years ago, responding to public pressure against soaring rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), it is the largest such purchase in the history of the German capital. The opposition has criticized the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal firm Gewobag will take charge of thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimated the housing units overpaid by about 10 percent above their book value.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their actions. The FDP tweeted on Friday, calling the move a "waste of money" by the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).</seg>
<seg id="6">Already in mid-July, Gewobag won back 670 flats in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not published by the council at the time. The dispute over flats on the former exhibition avenue from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents, but in recent years it has become more attractive. Rental prices have doubled over the past decade, according to AFP, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nokia has filed a notice of opposition against the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, there is no likelihood of product confusion.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brno-based software development firm CCV is facing legal action from Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the Brno warehouse management company's program is called Lokia WMS, daily E15 reported. Nokia has therefore filed an objection to the application of the Lokia brand to the Industrial Property Office. CCV considers that substitution is unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers and has been on the market since last September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a brand that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand made famous in the past by mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. According to the CCV, the name Lokia is based on the Latin name for one kind of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="7">"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really going into the area of mobile phone production. And we do not want to compare it to a brand that may be missing a train in its field," said Tomáš Kormaňák, manager of CCV, in E15.</seg>
<seg id="8">The CCV applied for brand protection in August before the programme was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for goods and services in Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software to Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, also overlaps in Classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the opponent's claim as to the conformity on these classes of products and services. Realistically, however, they are completely different brands aimed at different target groups," said Ondrášek.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute over the brand can last for months, according to E15, and it can complicate the company's business.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to power the plane at twice the speed of the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine comes into service, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And the distance between London and New York, for example, could be covered in one hour.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed the speed of sound by five times, are complicated due to engine overheating. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The most important thing about Sabre is that it is a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gas generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets have not gone through as much development in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft engines have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around the middle of next year, and commercial flights around 2030.</seg>

<seg id="2">Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include Kuchař's lack of workers and shifts in subcontractors. This year demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected drop in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of 1.3 billion crowns and profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kovosvit now offers several properties, halls and land for sale, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the office building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to make its activities more efficient. The sale of the property is not part of any current solution, whether it is cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all our resources to investment development," the CEO said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines allowing five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth 30 million crowns to China. "Another contract in the same volume is under negotiation, which we would like to complete before the end of the year," Kuchař said. Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions on the Russian market and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. In May this year, it delivered another machine, and it is expected to deliver one more at the end of the year or early 2020.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main company investment this year was the switch of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundries, machine tools, turning machines and electricians.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to three thousand employees at one time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Shandor</seg>
<seg id="2">There is still confusion about the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated during the week that the army planned the final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence despite the wishes of the family, as bombastic as soldiers can. There were also discrepancies about the date of the funeral. The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, denied this.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday funeral date is agreed from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honours apply. We will still deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will take place on Friday and will not miss all military honours, including the fighter flight.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the popular general, because the funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past, at the decision of the organizers!</seg>
<seg id="5">This includes the former head of military intelligence Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shandor remembers his former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent and "good guy."</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, he met him regularly in recent years at the celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. This is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Lightning.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates will usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said the security expert. He also does not like the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of the military leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The leadership of the army is not kept secret and neither are the leaders of the military intelligence, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the information of the media is true and the family has really been upstaged by the army, it is of course a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and their wishes," concluded Shandor.</seg>
<seg id="9">Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Spindleruv Mlyn on Saturday. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of a sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).</seg>
<seg id="10">The amateur racer on the turn was supposed to enter the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Manage the railways as a company</seg>
<seg id="2">Sky's election, although apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give a clear direction to the railways. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, it remains unchanged because one of the members has resigned. The proviso continues.</seg>
<seg id="3">The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning because the requirements for candidates were significantly relaxed, especially in the field of experience. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to serve in the past were reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nebeský presented perhaps the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he rubbed up against experienced players from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the lightest aspect (and the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they played only the role of a narrative backdrop in the political game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Perhaps Nebeský will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the taste of a political tobacconist. Czech Railways does not have an easy time, it has to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and the lack of employees in operation. There are no drivers, shifters and mechanics. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in a china shop in the top management?</seg>
<seg id="6">The second important group is the creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring, when the railways defend the rating. What is certain is that the creditors perceive the instability. Sadly, someone else comes to Moody's to defend the rating for Czech Railways every year. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in the management of the railways and the political influence on the company, it criticized them this summer.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ANO movement coined, among other things, the slogan that the state must be run as a company. For a start, it would be enough if it ran one large state-owned company as a company and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were led by the best. They applied, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves for the antics of the selection process.</seg>

<seg id="2">The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. However, her partner of ten years did not like the fact that it was a dog, so he decided to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="3">"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated its vocal expression. He placed the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment when they threw the dog into the water, the dog was clearly alive," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.</seg>
<seg id="4">The following day, children who were playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman called 911.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Thanks to the knowledge of the residents of the town, the police found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," the police spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Expert advice from veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly harrowing manner as a result of asphyxiation, when the animal suffered in a matter of minutes before death.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly point to a clear intention to dispose of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even if they could have donated or sold the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. The two previously unpunished accused could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015, which concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country is linked to an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.</seg>
<seg id="3">The scientists mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and which houses a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.</seg>
<seg id="4">Erdogan retaliates for coup, despite international criticism</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite the clear conclusions of the study, it seemed to Sika that the government was not taking any action on the matter, so he wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for leaking classified information.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the ruling. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be withheld. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Instead of pursuing people who sound the alarm through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkish branch.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fastest man on the planet missed tests. I'm not taking anything, he's fighting back</seg>
<seg id="2">The traditionally much-watched race for the fastest man on the planet will be a race for defending silver champion Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was in jeopardy due to a case of missed drug tests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three drug tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offense was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test itself until June 6. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit an offense in the form of three failed inspections in 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the data in the app about the whereabouts of athletes. "I don't take drugs or anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the World Cup.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two people, a man († 63) and a woman († 38), were travelling on the plane. "The plane at 8: 30 p.m. requested permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatovy," said police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at which time it was supposed to be located near Vojovic near Žinkov, according to GPS coordinates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it did not reach Klatovy airport. A search was immediately launched for the missing aircraft, which sent out a distress signal. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was involved," said police spokesperson Martina Korandová. However, the search operation did not have a happy ending.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the forest near Petrovic, near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane last reported, a helicopter crew spotted the wreckage before 9 a.m. "We found the plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandová confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, and pieces also hit the ground nearby. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Professional Investigation of Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Civilization on borrowed time</seg>
<seg id="2">I recently recalled a beautiful "line" from one of Shimka's great short stories with Grossmann, which took place partly in a cemetery, which reads as follows: "I pointed out to her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving in a very similar way.</seg>
<seg id="3">They act as if the planet Earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its enormous forces like a gust of wind a candle flame. Probably not many of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries about the destructive powers of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to "fart" and our advanced civilization to shit itself out of it.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it is highly likely that this will happen in the near future. Many large volcanoes, according to leading volcanologists, are "charged and armed" (for example, Katla in Iceland).</seg>
<seg id="5">In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it has to happen once, happened as soon as possible, before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano, along with dust and toxic volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more into the air than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">It therefore makes no sense to forcibly restrict CO2 production. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that with a significantly higher proportion of CO2 in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any warming is significantly more beneficial than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.</seg>
<seg id="7">If we consider the hitherto insufficiently studied impact of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot measure our strength at the least cost!</seg>

<seg id="1">Repairs to the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed for a year</seg>
<seg id="2">The Krkonoše National Park Authority (KRNAP) has postponed by three weeks the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabi. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is to reduce the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is a price that we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year behind schedule. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Service, European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not at risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">The KRNAP administration failed to select the construction company for the repairs of the museum. It launched a second competition this summer because in the previous tender all bids from the companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. Bids exceeded 100 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="6">The museum, which is located in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at 210 million crowns. The now cleared building should create a KRNAP visitor centre by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors to the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible form possible and motivate people to explore the mountains and protect them. It should also take over the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities to organise concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research centre or a café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not exactly standard, the customer really had to go after this car in a targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.</seg>
<seg id="3">Toyota Chief Executive Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will arrive next year, because Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be equal in price to hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. However, the future is linked to hydrogen as well as electricity.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the conference, the word hydrogen was often used with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but instead of large tractors, boats, trains, etc.Just those means of transport that need to cover long distances for a single refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.</seg>
<seg id="5">It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.</seg>

<seg id="2">When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or a cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, then you are one of the warm types. When choosing a new red lipstick, first and foremost, just sort it out based on the undertone. Only in the next one, take into account the texture.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you are one of those women with a cold undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Purposeful slander? Ústecká zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested</seg>
<seg id="2">The last time was at the end of this month. The management of the city attributed this to rumors that arose around the former director of the zoo and at the same time veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals that he cared for, such as the female rhino Zamba, the elephant Kalu and the orangutan Nyuňák.</seg>
<seg id="3">The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city centre for animals in need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said Romana Macová, the city spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="4">Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant defamation of such a quality expert," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts specialised in exotic animals are very few, she said. "It is definitely not pleasant. The zoo is still providing veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "However, the garden has to comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained Nikola Roštejnská, spokesperson for the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="6">Václav Poživil himself is one of the most respected experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous rumors about himself. Yesterday he did not receive phone calls or respond to text messages.</seg>
<seg id="7">As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinary surgeons think that in the absence of interest in it, there is not necessarily a fear of similar purposeful allegations as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, the veterinary surgeon Jiří Král has not yet heard of it. "This is the first time I have heard from you. No one has approached us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Prague Transport Company has selected an architect who will oversee the design of the Metropolitan Metro. From October she will become Anna Švarc, her primary task will be the appearance of the new D line, but she will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, travelling by subway should also bring an aesthetic experience.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Czech architect who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won a tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to her, 14 other applicants took part in the tender. "Part of the tender was a letter of motivation and a curriculum vitae. Apparently my previous experience in London decided, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people," says the new metro architect. According to her, her experience at the Institute of Planning and Development of the City of Prague could also decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The metro is not only perceived as a transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, I will not know how it will actually take place until the next few weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas," says Švarc.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is Ideal or whether a person can cover it, I really don't know yet," concludes Švarc.</seg>

<seg id="1">The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins</seg>
<seg id="2">Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farm in Nové Vsi u Leština in Havlíčkobrodsko was opened today for more than a month by the Pumpkin World. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year because pumpkins in the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipkovy family have matured longer. Even now there are many in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the last two years the weather did not favor them. This year's harvest was delayed and some types did not work out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types for fine pumpkins did not work out," said Pipková. However, the farm can choose from several types, from the large pumpkins already mentioned, suitable for carving and pawing decorations over hokaido cooking pumpkins or oblong "spaghetti" to ornamental pumpkins of various colors and shapes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pumpkin-growing is laborious. Farmers manually dig up the plants and harvest their fruit, cutting the pumpkins from the stem with scissors. The Pipka pumpkin world has been open regularly since 2010, and previous years have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by straw attractions or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.</seg>
<seg id="5">Details of the event are available on the website of the farm, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even for pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other options for preparing pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we will be inspired," Pipková said. She pointed out that some housekeepers also put pumpkins on acid like cucumbers.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a meal ticket. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases also paid by the employer, but without any tax credit. The most advantageous value of a meal ticket for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell.

The other three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon qualifying session.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of the strong team of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek, who received a 50-second penalty for incorrect passing of the goal at the start of the ride, failed. Přindiš and Prskavc, on the other hand, can now rest and focus on Sunday's semi-final.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I set myself the goal of going down to 30 with the first run, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I turned out, because on Sunday it starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising the comfort in Seu. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst in the 14 days we have been here. But then in the race it was good and today it was better again. All the time it is beautiful, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.</seg>
<seg id="5">Flash was also happy. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first few goals, I didn't quite get it right. Then I drove the middle very well, without any problems and I knew I had the mileage, so there was a second mistake when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the coat of arms. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they will go to the start only at the end of the semi-final block. "I am not an early riser, it is also cold in the morning, and when you are here at 8: 00, it takes a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Přindiš. "Overall, the semi-final takes an hour and a half, which is quite a good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Flash.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of the three Czech singles players, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top 20, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the top part as planned, in the middle passage it seemed to me that I couldn't keep up and I wasn't going according to plan, but I managed to get into the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I made two pokes and I am just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Declaration of the End of the Right in the House or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?</seg>
<seg id="2">There have been recent reports in the media and commentaries about the upcoming coalition of these parties. Many applaud the fact that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather ask why these parties still identify themselves as right-wing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aside from the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the entities identify themselves or what brand is parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the party's top politicians, the TOP 09 is clearly a party of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and so hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). Stan is a party that basically blends its concept, ideology and electoral focus with the TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even labels itself as centrist in the long term - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you feel that I have taken everyone out of the same water? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, the free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of rightism? How many laws cutting people's freedoms with the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing supervision, increasing the link with the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender insanity in recent years have they supported? A lot, a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And this has nothing to do with rightism.</seg>
<seg id="5">I would not be surprised at the coalition cooperation between TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and apart from Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not really see a clear difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as the "only right-wing" and by associating with these three entities it is already openly revealing its true political position.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the way, when I briefly mentioned the labels, did you notice how often all these parties quite consistently and cheaply refer to critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can they not or just do not want to understand that there are many people who do not like Euro-socialism and growing disenfranchisement as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not hiding their utter argumentative incompetence and their gratuitous or blind adoration of the European Union's circumstances?</seg>
<seg id="7">In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want such a union. Maybe they want left-of-center politics under the guise of the "right," because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they cannot even identify them). I do not know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminalistic slang, but they are also investigated if new information emerges years later, especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminologist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, which was then 12 years old. "The case from 1955? It will be difficult, very difficult. It would like to start by finding a file, it may no longer exist, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovič.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely reported to the public, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they are investigated laxly. "It has always been up to specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s can be destroyed, even if unclosed cases should not be shredded.</seg>

<seg id="1">The launch of the new toll is not at risk, reports Kremlík. However, a change of operator is in play</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a backup plan that the state would use if the current toll contract were finally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another interim solution if the tender could not be completed in time. The Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for YES) said on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure for the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state would thus look in the tender for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor for the use of the old system, which is now operated by Kapsch.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to Kremlík, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience with the toll tender process so far, I am deeply convinced that the OPC is wrong and that it is not objectively possible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator within the stipulated period of 12 months," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to the new tender procedure, the Ministry will also prepare a provisional solution that would resolve toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a fully fledged form of solution.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, the state will probably not take advantage of the offer made to it in recent days by the current toll manager Kapsch. The Austrian company offered the state the operation of the existing system in case the toll contract is cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that a backup plan will not be needed, so the ministry will file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">The OHS issued a decision on Thursday banning the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will only take effect one year after the authority's decision becomes final. This is not final and can be appealed to the chairman of the authority. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.</seg>

<seg id="1">I still see myself as a boy who's just getting his bearings, says Jan Cina</seg>
<seg id="2">"It was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, I was completely fascinated by it," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have been very attracted to him. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. It was hard and honest, but it was also fun. It was shot on the National Avenue, where I drove a car as a non-driver. There was also a lot of shooting in the South Town in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just getting his bearings. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he said, not even thinking about the acceptance speech in the event of victory. "Not really, but as a child, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself speaking to people."</seg>
<seg id="5">Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he said, recalling the Czech Lions awards, when his friend fell on the stairs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Yes, it really happened. He had new slick shoes and the red carpet was slick too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a Vančur Steps workshop where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Our band currently has seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on 17 August, he was born by a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is a male Hitam. For the first days after the birth, the female carried the cub tightly to her body and for a long time she did not want to show the world if she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, she started to put it away for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said Alena Houšková, spokesperson for the zoo, noting that the Children's Zoo has successfully raised 12 cubs of this species.</seg>
<seg id="3">Crested macaques are so-called endemic to the island of Sulawesi, meaning that they do not live in the wild anywhere else in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and plume on their heads, according to which they have a name. Crested macaques live in the rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like most primates, it feeds on both plant and animal food. The diet is dominated very significantly by the fruits of forest trees, which complement flowers and leaves. It addresses the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Apart from the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a popular prey with tasty meat and for fur. It is also fatal for these animals to burn and cut down the rainforest," the spokesperson said.</seg>

<seg id="1">And where are the spectators? Doha can't be London</seg>
<seg id="2">At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as by travelling to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and consciously renounced the riveting atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and at the European Championships in Berlin last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers call for "the biggest sporting event of 2019." However, concerns about how dignified its backdrop will be are growing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," according to the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="5">But that's too little.</seg>
<seg id="6">The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with brightly coloured tarpaulins, which also display the flags of 209 participating countries. Athletics in Qatar has gone to a territory where it does not have roots, despite the annual Diamond League meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let us not be surprised, then, that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the Championships, even though their price started at 60 cathartic rials, i.e. less than 400 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="8">Organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered stands, which is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (though the organizers themselves deny it) handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Rich Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics comes soccer in 2022. Financial offers from the oil power will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but sigh with pure sportsmanship that the experiment with the first outdoor World Championships for athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by the IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, imposed by the climate, breaks the whole pattern of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the crucial Olympic season, which would normally have started for athletes in October.</seg>
<seg id="11">Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it is just 37 degrees? Already the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are designed to give television viewers a detailed overview of what happens in athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.</seg>

<seg id="2">In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday's match against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Everyone wants to go up against Sparta," says the player before the fifth round of the extra league.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hradec Králové will try to stretch his winning streak, which at the moment includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Plzeň came the most appreciated by fans on Sunday, and Mountfield went to neighbouring Pardubice to get it.</seg>
<seg id="5">"However, we cannot look at the matches as they were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them in the same way, if not better," says the midfielder.</seg>
<seg id="6">The players should not look back on last year's record with Sparta either. They lost in three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management brought in some significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them</seg>
<seg id="2">The Central Bank of Venezuela is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies, following instructions from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which is seeking to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil firm's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal that the central bank should be able to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to a 30-year low, Bloomberg reported, citing information from four sources.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system, adding to the country's economic crisis, with the current crisis one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a patchwork of different ways to move money. While Maduro's effort to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency has failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways to circumvent restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not clear how PDVSA got its own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value it owns. The company is struggling to get payments from customers through conventional channels because major banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="6">PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, because that would require it to register on the exchange and submit to due diligence, called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency to pay entities it owes to PDVSA. Oil company officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain to authenticate and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are made possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and client information related to them, which complicate compliance.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are making a comeback this year on expectations of greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Neckermann is cancelling flights in connection with the insolvency of Britain's Thomas Cook and his German daughter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., which goes by the trade name Neckermann Travel Office, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="4">"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel scheduled departures of its clients," he added, noting that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. According to him, the 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic will be ensured by their scheduled flight."</seg>
<seg id="6">The travel agency admitted that some clients have been asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to contact the SK Neckermann SOS line immediately," added Šrámek.</seg>
<seg id="7">The collapse of Thomas Cook took place on Monday, and in August this year, the travel agency struck a deal to inject £900 million into the firm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to receive half of the sum from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism, which was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as September 20, it was reported that creditors had asked the travel agency to obtain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal would fall through.

<seg id="2">The Americans also won the third World Cup of 17, beating Spain just 77-75 in the final, despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep it up because they rolled us under the basket," said captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Plzeň.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Czechs started very well, thanks to two three-pointers they took an 8-0 lead and dominated the field throughout the first quarter. At that moment it seemed that they would repay their opponents for the 85-88 defeat after extra time. However, the referees gave them 15 fouls at half-time and with questionable decisions they helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 lead.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm convinced that all we had to do was make two or three more baskets, run for 20 points and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead our mistakes came. I don't care about the referees, I care about what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch on," said coach Richard Fousek.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and they fought to the end. The opponent was very good," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Petra Holešínská and Tereza Šípová, the leading Czech scorer, had a problem with fouls and was absent from the field for a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarian women took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they already held, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="8">"For us, the first five games were very difficult, we turned the games around in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Even against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Because of our physicality, we were not consistent in our defence. We did not play a quick counterattack, we lacked a catch. And the Hungarians are so good that if you do not combine everything together, it is difficult to win," added Fousek.</seg>
<seg id="9">He believes his charge has a promising future. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, to be second in the European Championship for 16-year-olds and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, they are a quality team with good character and we need to continue to work with them and develop their talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," Fousek added.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly one of the compact SUVs, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves this item to the larger Sportage sibling, which is such a direct answer to cars such as the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, the XCeed is also betting on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear end, can remotely resemble the world of the SUV-coupe, which is particularly popular in this part of the market among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the other hand, the XCeed can not only be placed alongside plasticised versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so if you don't want to, Ceed may not even see the new shapes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with supercharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a supercharged litre and also offers a supercharged sixteen-hundred with 150 kW, reserved for siblings of the GT version. Don't expect a sporty stage here. The 1.6 CRDi turbochargers are only offered in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic alongside the manual.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon, the offer will be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that can travel about six tens of kilometers on electricity alone. The batteries can then be charged from a normal socket.</seg>

<seg id="1">The autotuner brought the voice of the digital soul</seg>
<seg id="2">Everything you know about obesity is wrong, says the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative afterthought, the medical community has for decades ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and unnecessary) war against overweight people that has not only scarred public opinion but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="3">What Hobbes says right from the start is that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing the facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains as early as the seventeenth century handed out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that this would prevent disease. However, the British Navy abandoned the practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in preventing and treating the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they did not become mandatory until the 1960s, just as the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.</seg>
<seg id="5">Obesity is viewed as an eminently personal failure of an individual who is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of being fat is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more weight than they lost.</seg>
<seg id="6">Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic, where, for example, in faculties, when teaching future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours of his entire studies to nutrition issues. Which, at a time when the 60 calorie processes Americans take in come from ultra-processed food - that is, overly processed food.</seg>
<seg id="7">The stigmatized nature of obesity is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people tend to have shorter checkups, are treated with less empathy by doctors, and are considered more problematic patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">But overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, obesity rates have doubled in 73 countries around the world, rising in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop the increase. Absolutely none.</seg>

<seg id="6">- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million</seg>
<seg id="7">- Problem: Lack of money for hosting, increasing reforestation fee for promoter Dorna</seg>
<seg id="8">- possible solutions: More money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices</seg>
<seg id="9">- state of play: Negotiations on a new contract for the organisation of races for the next five years</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix drains money from public budgets for other issues. To some extent, however, it is a political issue and not an economic one," he thinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the future, the cost of a motorsport event may be even higher, because the option of increasing the reforestation fee to almost double is in play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organisation of the race. If the worst case scenarios materialise, I fear that it is not realistic for the city and the county to pay the amount," said Markéta Vaňková, the mayor of Brno.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the Journal of Equality has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the coming years, organizers can also get more money from tickets. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets," said Petr Vokřál, the Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor.</seg>

<seg id="1">D5 accident: Motorway closed by truck collision</seg>
<seg id="2">The incident was reported around 08: 00 on the 22nd kilometre in the direction of Prague. "The motorway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through a petrol station," police spokesperson Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 14: 30. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire department, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was carrying passenger cars and the other a plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were moved, which the fire department had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, which leaked about 200 liters of diesel fuel. Another 200 liters were drained by firefighters. Workers from the environment department of Beroun City Council were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the clearing of the highway were provided by a private company, which also removed contaminated soil.</seg>

<seg id="1">Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha</seg>
<seg id="2">The World Championships in Doha started with qualification failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800 metres and neither pole-sitter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place she surprised in London last year, qualified.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hurdler Vít Müller will complete the run on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Šafránková threw 65.46 meters with her third attempt and fell nearly six meters short of her best this year, which she would have had to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mezuliáníková, who reached the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the International Federation of the IAAF, finished in the fourth run in the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2: 03.48 minutes was not enough for her to reach the semi-finals. She was one and a half seconds behind her best this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent on the corner, which quite robbed me of my strength. I felt like I still had the strength, but there it slowed me down. I almost stopped and had to start again, so in this it was a bit uncomfortable. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was happy to overtake at least one opponent at the finish line. "She was really not well, so every beaten opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she said. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyondo from Uganda in 2: 00.36.</seg>
<seg id="7">Doha is missing the top eight-footer in recent years, Caster Semenya of South Africa, who has too high a testosterone level in her body but, like some other runners, is refusing the treatment mandated by the IAAF rules from this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 100-meter dash, American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favorite, with a time of 9.98, the only one below the 10-second mark. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is trying to defend his title at 37, also advanced to the semifinals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's standings at 9.86, did not start and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 record this season.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form in the long-distance qualification, reaching a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped this far in the qualification of the World Championship in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with 865 cm.</seg>

<seg id="1">Which cities will disappear under the sea?</seg>
<seg id="2">The vote by Canada's upper house of parliament has confirmed a familiar rumour for days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, has lost her honorary degree for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision to take away Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously endorsed it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the world," independent Senator Ratna Omidvar commented on her colleagues' decision. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honest citizens."</seg>
<seg id="4">The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary degree, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of the long-time human rights activist on the atrocities that the army of majority Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fact that there is an officially organised genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently reported by the UN. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, the report said, "shock both the horror of their actions and the huge scale." According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her administration have been complicit mainly in covering up the actions of the soldiers and releasing a fog of lies around them - for example, that it is an "anti-terrorist operation."</seg>
<seg id="6">After Suu Kyi's removal, five individuals remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims, and Malala Yousafzai.</seg>
<seg id="7">Developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile was accompanied by information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take away her title of honorary citizen. "We have also dimmed the lighting of her picture on a tablet showing the timeline of the fight for human rights and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only thing that will remain so in Suu Kyi's current turmoil - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "While Ms Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be rescinded," the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told CBS Canada.</seg>

<seg id="1">Microplastics reach human intestines, study confirms for the first time</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. The team, led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwable, published a study showing for the first time the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - small particles of plastic measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all the people studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of whom did not avoid sea fish, all of whom drank water from plastic bottles and food wrapped in plastic.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example, for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are produced by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive system of humans has only been officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 particles of microplastics per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, both lay and scientific consciousness suspect that this is not a good thing. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the presence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," says Schwabl.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is now known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, making it easier for toxic chemicals and other pathogens to be absorbed into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least halt its steep rise. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more than it does today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles bought per minute. Every year, roughly eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some countries have already taken restrictions and other measures, such as Kenya banning plastic bags - under threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), and the country's environment ministry is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, say that such measures, while nice, are totally inadequate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana († 36)! Where is Meghan?</seg>
<seg id="2">Diana was exceptional in that she could hold people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, a minefield. Pictures of her wearing a protective suit and face shield became iconic. Even then, no one could have known that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would take her last breath in a tragic car crash in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now her younger son, Harry, has also scored well, going to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a mine clearance site in Dirico, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly couldn't help remembering his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of 13.</seg>
<seg id="4">Harry gave a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find the peace with which opportunities come," he said, also appealing for the preservation and preservation of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After that visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mum, Princess Diana.</seg>
<seg id="5">He did not forget to mention it on his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to get to know their tireless mission and to speak for all those who (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not exactly popular worldwide," the Sussex Royal Instagram post said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Royal fans, however, may be annoyed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest to remember Diana. Both have had separate agendas towards Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield does not sound very safe, and Harry does not want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.</seg>

<seg id="1">Only children. We don't have certain reproduction, but we don't have to worry</seg>
<seg id="2">Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. They include the word "only child." It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. "You know, only child," it is said, without needing to add anything. Interestingly, "only child" has carried this trait since time immemorial, back when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but European states do not have a simple rate of reproduction of the population. (Within the West, only Israel is out of line with the total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová is also failing: "There are almost as many only children as two-child families," she said in an interview with LN. But she omitted the devil hidden in the detail.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying it or ideologizing it, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children is easily labelled as fascist (in the style of "so did Hitler"). It is good to be reminded that many couples plan only children directly. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from becoming pregnant again). But despite all this, let us draw attention to one thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only children," there is a drop of demagogy. This statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us remember that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a frightening 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with this alarmism can they reduce a little bit.</seg>

<seg id="2">Costa Rica received the title for several reasons, starting with a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but many countries have pledged to do so under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis running on electricity.</seg>
<seg id="3">The official tourism organization says that already about 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated for a total of 300 days.</seg>
<seg id="4">Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The density of forests also contributes to reducing emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot given the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforests, foggy forests, coral reefs or mangrove marshes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, quaint waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.</seg>

<seg id="2">Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering her education. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. Similar conduct can be considered a criminal offence, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court's ruling could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can also be considered necessary to guide further application practice," according to Zeman's appeal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year, the Svitavy District Court first found the woman guilty of torturing the person in charge and endangering the child's education. She formed a strong, even symbiotic bond with her daughter, even when she should have been entrusted to her father.</seg>
<seg id="5">The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm if she was transferred to the care of the father.</seg>
<seg id="6">The svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to rule again.</seg>
<seg id="7">The regional court found that situations where one parent manipulates a child against another are not uncommon. They are dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only rarely is the solution criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, according to the Attorney General, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her education. "The accused acted in a completely targeted manner by arousing negative feelings towards her father in her daughter and deliberately reinforcing these negative emotions. By doing so, she not only pursued the illegal intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must have been aware that it would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," according to the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="9">Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the regional court one more time. The appeal shows that the child is now in the care of the father.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young Czechs think they can do it with money. Survey does not confirm it</seg>
<seg id="2">"It turns out, therefore, that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly greater share of the wrong answers," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of KRUK.</seg>
<seg id="3">Men and young high school or college students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial affairs from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).</seg>
<seg id="5">Women, in particular, consult parents on financial issues, while men are more likely to search the internet for information. Obtaining financial information from parents is prevalent in all ages of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses from financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal impact.</seg>

<seg id="8">Young people are clearly on the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or flat, or to enjoy themselves and spend the money, without saving and living on their own.</seg>
<seg id="9">94 per cent of respondents follow a strategy of saving and investing in fixed tangible assets. This is true across all ages of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.</seg>
<seg id="10">The strategy of the survey is 100% supported by people married with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income above 30,000 crowns per month are more likely to enjoy themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">The hunter was injured when he fell from a sitting position and was carried to the ambulance for three hours</seg>
<seg id="2">The unfortunate accident occurred before 7: 30 p.m. in the peak areas near Čertova mlýn.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescue workers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," said Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rescuers found the hunter in the designated area with multiple injuries. They treated him immediately and then gently but with difficulty transported him on a so-called Austrian cart across the impassable terrain.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.</seg>

<seg id="2">Anyone who moves in a divided society and does not want to completely fool around will welcome situations where they do not have to root for their own. When they can admit the pros to someone they otherwise criticise, if only so that they do not feel that they are only oriented according to pre-allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments, which President Zeman fenced during his favourite trips to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everyone knows what is going on. And anyone who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic can see many of the devastated monuments - from the centres of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy can also come into play here. If we accuse the town hall of not caring about monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it could be the work of former administrations. Or it could be a privatised building whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "The section of the Monuments Act allows you to fine owners of buildings who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is undetectable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement, which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognise as a plus.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause in a similar way to squatters, which he does not recognise himself. Two years ago we wrote: "Despite all the abuse, squatters point out a problem outside the current interest. That this or that building is in a state of emergency." And let's face it, the president is doing de facto the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you come to the historic centre of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and tolar-stamping (for Americans dollars). Why? Allegedly due to the rapid sale of houses in the 1990s, officials there say. But why is it that seven kilometres away the Island, the seat of the Šliků, who mined the Jáchymov tolars, has its historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the President draws attention to these things.</seg>

<seg id="2">Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited Ground Zero in New York on September 27, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="3">Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said so today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's a very moving place," the prime minister said as he, accompanied by his wife Monica, placed a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousk and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 people killed in the hijacked plane attack on the former pair of World Trade Center (World Trade Center) skyscrapers. The World Trade Center towers collapsed after the crash, and in their place there is now a memorial with a list of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We need to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001, was described by the prime minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the World Trade Center skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Defense Ministry building in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. However, the plane crashed when passengers confronted the hijackers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should come together and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.</seg>

<seg id="3">Who will be challenged in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-final than the Polish world champions.

<seg id="1">Technology companies want to rule our cities</seg>
<seg id="2">In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point in the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of governance."</seg>
<seg id="3">Twenty-six years later, we are more likely to see illiberal models prevail from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thrive. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the rise of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is rethinking many of his former positions: He argues that the ideas of socialism should return to the public domain, and Marx was right about a lot of things, although he also insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and that critics of The End of History and the Last Man did not get it right.</seg>
<seg id="4">"What I said at the time was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and that's why they group together into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging."</seg>
<seg id="5">In its day, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a powerful argument against Marxists, who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked about how he now feels about the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then, except when clear services to the public are in demand, I don't think it will work. But if you are thinking about redistribution programmes that try to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. That long period, which was started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher and in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, has had a disastrous effect in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="6">In the end, Fukuyama is trying to defuse the current situation, warning all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The army practiced the parade over recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled into the square on empty streets and fighter jets circled in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would display its military might, but one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would unsettle other nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">She appeared to be referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up, but there may also be concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-appointed caretaker.</seg>
<seg id="5">Celebrations are also planned outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of China's ten most innovative cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ahead of the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing. It already includes drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and devices using radio waves, the Guardian pointed out. It added that China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party is staying (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who studies China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.</seg>
<seg id="8">The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 when Communists led by Mao Zedong won a battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Czechs or children banned from entering. Choi reveals discrimination in restaurants</seg>
<seg id="2">These included, for example, erroneous price information and failure to comply with the principles of fair sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children into the establishment. According to ČOI, it writes on its website that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by a consumer if it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child under the age of four, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich said.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the second case, another Prague company did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to sit at the table, while allowing English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," said a spokesman for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet definitively concluded, a spokesperson for the inspection could not give further information on the restaurants in question.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, discrimination occurred in only a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, Choi carried out 139 inspections. Apart from the two cases of discrimination, it detected other errors in 64 cases. Most of them were deficiencies in respect of the principles of fairness of sales and failure to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed.</seg>

<seg id="1">For holidays with just a credit card? Neo account offers free withdrawals from ATMs all over the world!</seg>
<seg id="2">According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, security, as well as the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.</seg>
<seg id="3">Travellers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying by card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, do not have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even" vacationers "do not want to rely on cash to make ends meet. In addition, some foreign currencies are not even available to Czech banks or exchange offices. We have therefore solved this with the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, a payment card is a much more reliable way than cash not to lose your money. If you lose a full wallet, the owner may not be able to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. If he acts quickly, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and managed completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100,000 euros and the account management is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.</seg>
<seg id="5">For anyone planning to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay with an online card, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a payment card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, for embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part when travelling abroad to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are travelling. This often eliminates any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all the activities that travellers plan to undertake.</seg>

<seg id="1">A pike in a pond or a relatively prosperous chancellery?</seg>
<seg id="2">Babiš chose statistics for his optimistic view, such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt, or the fact that our country is 24th in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="3">Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, also presented other, not nearly as "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic is ranked 154th in the world in terms of the speed of construction procedures. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave any significant building heritage as it did in the past.</seg>
<seg id="4">The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy, which is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags far behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with improving living standards will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, in the capital city of Prague, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring, or to build an Expressway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason is not only the absurd wrangling over architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bold change is for the worse."</seg>
<seg id="7">And when it seems that something bolder could be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by monuments or other somewhat stubborn associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to join the dredgers.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building train express trains, so Germany eventually decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes drowned in the shenanigans. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a puzzle.</seg>
<seg id="9">Babiš came into politics promising to "get things done." As far as meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are concerned, not much has happened so far. Since 2018, there has been an amendment to the law on the acceleration of construction of transport infrastructure, but we will have to wait for the larger positive effects of, for example, easier expropriation of land. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average length of construction procedures from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has received six requests in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary finally acquitted him.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both the Attorney General Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová did not appeal the case.</seg>
<seg id="4">The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec public prosecutor's office charged him with the then 20-year-old student of the Nečesaný Gymnasium. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by doctors at the Hradec hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">Uncombed denied any wrongdoing from the start. "I am innocent and I swear on that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was at the hair salon on the fateful day, said he wanted to get a haircut. He left after the woman told him that he was already closing up. He then came forward as a witness to the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hairdresser at first did not recognize him as the aggressor during questioning, but later identified Uncombed as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from blackouts after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hradec Regional Court handed down five consecutive sentences in the case. First, it found Uncombed guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, while the Appeals High Court reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed gradually went to prison twice, but each time he was freed after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered replacement of the bench, the last one was upheld by the High Court in March this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but that due to the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said that he rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an evaluation of it. We consider that sufficient evidence was gathered in the pre-trial proceedings, which in another criminal case would have been more than sufficient for the admission of guilt," Lněnička stated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, both the Hradec and the Supreme Court took a different view of the case and their opinion would probably not have been changed by the further annulment of the acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to surgery he has a new hope</seg>
<seg id="2">For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into space for a few minutes, became immobile and did not react to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to the pediatric neurological clinic, where after a series of examinations, doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and started to lead him more into sports. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorboards, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. At the age of 11, however, he had another seizure and it all started again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, the seizures in the form of absences kept repeating themselves. Since during the attack Honza always lost consciousness, his parents were terrified that he would get it in sport and get injured. Gradually Honza stopped cycling and swapped downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboards. Although from time to time the sport caused him to have a seizure, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="5">When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at the FN in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a deposit from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have two operations in a row, first the doctors put probes into my brain to take pictures of his activity, then they were able to remove the bearing. It was hell for me for several weeks. I just had to lie there and hardly move, wires sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer," recalls Honza.</seg>
<seg id="6">The operation was successful and the doctors removed the relatively large deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how he is normally alive and communicative, it was a scary change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," says the mother, adding: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. Since then he has been free of seizures for 3 months."</seg>
<seg id="7">This school year Honza will graduate, besides sports he enjoys languages and has started working with the E Society, with which he goes to meetings about epilepsy in schools. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports slowly. "I am learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year, therefore, they will not actively participate in the traditional Eppi water triathlon, which brings together epilepsy sufferers and healthy athletes, and which is already taking place this weekend on 28 September 2019 in Veselská sandbox. But next year, perhaps, they will.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xxx Lutz can buy rival Kik, authority says, but there's a catch</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábět and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other, subject to the fulfilment of structural commitments set out in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the OHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it has to sell off part of the purchased company.</seg>
<seg id="4">XLCEE-Holding is also buying branches of Kika in other countries where the chain operates, namely Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the transaction must be authorised by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa holding company was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year at a symbolic price.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish firm IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. It faced problems when it discovered discrepancies in its accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Xxx Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Furniture and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner is the Möbelix brand. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about $114 billion).</seg>

<seg id="1">The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Václav IV with a manuscript exhibition</seg>
<seg id="2">Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech kings Vaclav IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Klementino, Prague. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open both days from 10: 00 to 18: 00.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatu domini Regis: From the Royal Office and the Library of Václav IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The written heritage from the reign of Václav IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on agriculture by Petr de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or to the Breviar, a prayer book by one of the Benedictines of St. George's Monastery in Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts a semi-figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, was also involved in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin collection of John Wycliffe's tracts from the period about 1411 to 1414.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not a single book has been preserved from the Václav IV library in the Czech Republic. According to experts, this library was one of the largest and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library died soon after Václav's death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. However, several codes were saved. The Austrian National Library owns the most of them today.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the day of Saturday's public holiday, an exhibition entitled What hides under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be opened free of charge in Klementinum.</seg>

<seg id="2">The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate the jubilee of her life in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Actress Petra Černocká has never looked like a typical grandmother who had her hair streaked with grey, wore sedate things and went out sporadically. She has always looked after herself and the older she gets, the more she can unwind in looking at her image.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fortunately, she hasn't succumbed to the trend of plastic surgery and is taking care of her skin with a good old-fashioned indulona, and her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off, but now she has changed her hair color and completely figured it out.</seg>
<seg id="5">When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket, which made her even brighter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate the fact that even at the age of 70, they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, who looks to be no more than 50.</seg>
