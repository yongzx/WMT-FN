<seg id="1">Driving on high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Many young people accidentally pedaling accidentally (Auto Messe Web)-Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="3">Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">The number of reports of accidents due to erroneous operation such as pedaling mistakes is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In terms of the number of accidents in pedaling accidents by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the most frequent ages are 1080 under the age of 24 and more than 1032 over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="6">Missteps are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call the young people as well.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you take fashion under your feet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you take safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">Although this data does not describe the ratio of males and females and the cause, unlike the elderly, who are often thought to be due to physical deterioration such as driving skills and reflexes, young people are distracted by other things such as music and conversation. Inadvertent mistakes or wrong footsteps due to clothes etc. are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, some women choose high shoes, pumps, sandals, mules, and various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, and some of them drive as they are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although some people find it difficult to change their shoes while knowing that they are not suitable for driving, many of them are driving without fear of thinking that it may lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving with high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is Article 70 “Violation of safe driving duty” which stipulates “to operate the steering wheel, brake and other operations with certainty” and “Do not drive in such a way as to cause an accident and harm the person”.</seg>
<seg id="14">And the other is Article 71 "Violations of Public Safety Commission compliance matters" which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters established by each prefectural public safety committee. For example, in the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, The article states, "Do not drive a vehicle (excluding light-duty vehicles) with sleds, slippers, gimmicks, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with driving operation, or with footwear that interferes with driving operation. There is a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="15">All prefectures have the same purpose to regard driving with “footwear that may interfere with driving” as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.</seg>
<seg id="16">So why is driving in high heels dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">It's clear considering the basics of safely pedaling.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe and secure pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot to the floor, place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt the tip of the foot to the right when using the accelerator pedal as a fulcrum.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to fix it firmly so that the heel does not shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small, and the heel constantly shakes, and the angle of the entire foot is angled by the height of the heel, so the area of ​​the foot that touches the pedal is also small. It is difficult to make fine adjustments, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is considered to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also, most cars have floor carpets, but this material tends to get caught in the heels of high heels, and the heels get caught when the driver suddenly brakes and the pedal cannot be depressed. In some cases, you may get stuck in the back of the pedal and cannot step on it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Furthermore, there are cases in which the heel is caught behind the pedal when the pedal is depressed and then returned, and the accelerator pedal cannot return.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the preface of "Bishojo Collection," there was a sentence that "it stands out because of the beauty of their girls, who are at the opposite end of fear and ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story." "Fear" may be more prominent because there is a contrast that turns into a grudge-inspiring grudge expression.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kazuo Umezu often uses the keyword "snake" that appears in many works, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as those who see snakes as "eerie creatures" and some who feel "beautiful." ..</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people in the world like reptiles, but some people just don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="11">In that way, the creature with "beauty" and "uglyness" may be a "snake" that is one side of the other depending on the sensitivity of the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, this creature has been revered as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" settled in is auspicious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Umezu's works on the theme of "snakes" include the 1965 "Mama ga scared!"</seg>
<seg id="14">Generally, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "snake woman".</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, it may be said that it is a "cool butty" type in an improvised way ... I think that is the common point among the beautiful girls who appear in Umezu.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among them, “Orochi”, who is the main character of “Orochi” serialized in “Weekly Shonen Sunday” from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Umezu's work, but eternal life and eternal youth Sleeping deeply every 100 years to keep it, and the part that has a mysterious power remind us of a snake somewhere.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The performance of the Iranian drone "Aberbir" used in this bombing has improved dramatically by analyzing the crashed US military drone in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="3">It can be manufactured at low cost and has a cruising range of about 1000 km.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since it flies in the low sky, it is also an advantage that it is difficult for radar to catch it.” (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 14, the oil facility of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the “Houshi”, announced a criminal statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's safe to say that what lies behind the Houthis is Iran, led by President Rouhani. Iran cannot forgive its opponents, Saudi Arabia, for making oil in a situation where it cannot export oil. The aim is to inform the international community that if a crude oil embargo is continued against Iran, the pain will be incurred accordingly.” (Izu Sugawara, International Political Analyst)</seg>
<seg id="8">The bombing has cut half as much oil production in Saudi Arabia as crude oil prices have surged by 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some say that the oil shock will come back if this situation continues.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Trump has pledged to withdraw US troops from the Middle East and would like to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's elections. With that knowledge, Iran will continue to hide the Houthis. Will continue to bomb drones in the US, but the United States can't stand forever. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future." (Sugawara)</seg>

<seg id="4">YouTuber is now extremely popular with young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, but there are companies that have begun to adopt the unusual system of "YouTuber employment" that they hire as regular employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, DmMiX) whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).</seg>
<seg id="7">What does it mean to "adopt YouTuber"?</seg>
<seg id="8">We interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the representative director of DmMiX and also the representative of the subsidiary, Staff First, where YouTuber was actually adopted.</seg>
<seg id="9">I want to support young people who are trying hard by adopting YouTuber</seg>
<seg id="10">――― What kind of mechanism is “YouTuber adoption” in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="11">Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter Kobayashi): The profession called YouTuber is now a yearning for many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is ranked high in the occupation rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people who are aiming will continue to increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">So far, we have hired and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, "YouTuber recruitment" is to recruit and support young people who are following the dream of becoming a YouTuber.</seg>
<seg id="15">――― There is an image that YouTuber is a person who voluntarily posts videos, but why did you decide to "recruit"?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the YouTuber profession, the reality is that most YouTubers can't make the desired profits.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who work and post videos while working part-time, and who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber in their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide the hired creators with an environment for salaries and content production.</seg>
<seg id="19">At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession called YouTuber, who is in an unstable position at first.</seg>

<seg id="2">&amp;lt;Men's Singles&amp;gt; (Bud x Spirit!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japan National Team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Basel, Switzerland) at the badminton big event held in August, finished the training camp in early September and started the Chinese OP from the 17th ( Entered Changzhou/Super1000).</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, looking back at the first half of the season from May to August, when the Olympics race for the Tokyo Olympics next year began, we will look at the men's singles for the midfield battle (September to December). / Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).</seg>
<seg id="5">The badminton Olympics race that started in May consumed four high-ranking competitions (Super500 or higher) in which top players participate at the end of the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first half of the game, Kenmochi Momota, who won 2 out of 4 tournaments, and Chou Tian Cheng, Taiwan, will have kept good results in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momoda won the World Championship, Zhou Tengli won the Indonesian OP (S1000), and the competition where you can get high points of the "World Ranking Points" that are directly connected to the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="8">Momoda also controls Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">The tournaments that we have participated in since May are 4 tournaments: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesian OP (July/results above 16), Japan OP (July), and World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number is small compared to other top players, the schedule has kept the burden on the body low.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since only one World Championship event was held in August, fatigue will not be greater than during consecutive battles.</seg>
<seg id="12">Good results are required in midfield games, where the top tournaments have continued since September.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ace of Taiwan that is strong against consecutive battles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also pay attention to young Thai people!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tengsei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in 7 tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the victory brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Originally a player who is physically strong and who does not suffer from consecutive battles.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the contrary, by gaining high points in the first half of the game, it would have been easier to adjust the schedule of the competitions that will be played in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zhou Tensei had the impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but this year he became more stable in terms of playing, and he is now able to maintain good results.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Momota, who is number one in the world ranking, it seems to be a more difficult opponent than ever.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to these two players, the results of the first half of the game were the young Thai ace Kantafon and India's Sai Planice B.</seg>
<seg id="23">Anders Anders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European player, is three players.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Kantafon doesn't make it to the finals in the top tournaments, it has the power to go on to the top, such as being in the best four in two tournaments this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th), who has become able to rally with top athletes, has a great potential to make a leap in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cy Planice B. also took a step out in India, where they have good singles players.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Barama, Planoi H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who lag behind due to injuries, will catch up, so be careful of the Indians after the mid-season.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October, new charge plans for mobile phone companies have been released.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the price remained high.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshii Suga said last summer that "there is room for a 40% reduction," and despite expectations for price reductions, price competition did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="5">The major factor is that the three major companies are still in an oligopolistic state because Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to seek the efforts of mobile companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revised law prohibits set discounts for terminal charges and communication charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is because the communication charges were set to be higher, instead of selling the terminal charges cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI(au) announced plans to cut the price of terminals up to half.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies have a mechanism that "SIM lock" is applied to the terminal, which cannot use other company's line for 100 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT Docomo will reduce the terminal cost up to one-third only for subscribers of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">It seems that all three companies are continuing to "enclose" to prevent transfer to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has announced a policy of requiring immediate release.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies need to take immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten has been postponed because the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a shameless dress because it was expected to be a catalyst for price cut competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">I wonder if there was a lack of outlook.</seg>
<seg id="19">The start date and price of the full-scale service have not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we want you to take responsibility and engage in business.</seg>
<seg id="21">This price revision was triggered by the statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Suga complained about the new tariffs of the three companies, "I think the competition will start from now.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is unlikely that the “government price cut” will distort the market and promote healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Businesses should develop customer-oriented competition before the government says it.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pricing system of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency called for caution, saying that there are cases where the burden on the consumer exceeds half the price even though the terminal has advertised that the price will be half the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company itself must give careful and easy-to-understand explanations to prevent misunderstandings from users.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was launched as a black star, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the latter half of the season is causing ripples.</seg>
<seg id="5">One shot with a shoulder tackle added to the opponent's face.</seg>

<seg id="11">Deep in the opponents, England captain Farrell lost some balance as he caught his ally's pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Quill who went to tackle this.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, I raised my upper body, not from the waist down, and hit the upper body violently.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the other person's head comes into contact with each other, and the head collides.</seg>
<seg id="15">Farrell was blasted hard and collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="16">An English player protests to push Quill into the apparently unjustified play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Both athletes gathered at once, and it was a quick air.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with a bad look, but some boos were heard from the crowd seeking fair play.</seg>

<seg id="5">In October, we will request the target hospitals to make a full-scale study on reorganization and integration, and have them reach a conclusion by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although there is no compulsory force, it is expected that local chiefs and local residents will repulse the fear of the disappearance of nearby hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at a meeting on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many hospitals had relatively few beds.</seg>

<seg id="4">Keisuke Honda, a former Japanese national team midfielder who has left the Australian A league's Melbourne Victory for the last season, is now in a surprising position.</seg>
<seg id="5">[Video] Keisuke Honda, were you actually in the match?</seg>
<seg id="6">The astonishing truth is revealed</seg>
<seg id="7">Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th of Japan time, said, "Give me an offer. You don't need money, but you have to play with a great team or a great teammate." It's fun.</seg>
<seg id="8">The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world-renowned person.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make a spectacular request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?</seg>
<seg id="10">The trigger was in an article on the Australian version of "FOX Sports" published on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an article titled "5 Manchester United FWs could catch in the aftermath of injuries," five independent players are currently available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonney, Honda also had the name.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, United is in an emergency with many injured such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marshall, FW Marcus Rushford.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "Red Devil" headed by Ole Gunner Seurchar is forced to make a difficult start with 2 wins and 22 losses in the league, and has problems with the quality of the front line.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, it was Honda that the Australian media named as a new force candidate for leveraging.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the article says, "Strictly speaking, it's not a striker, but Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the holes Andreas Pereira is filling in."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was pointed out that the nine-time score in 18 games at Melbourne Victory was a "steady record", but "33-year-old Honda needs to get away from his entertainment that manages the Cambodian national team and get full attention."</seg>
<seg id="18">Will Honda's approach pay off?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is also important to see if United will move because of the veteran who professes to be participating in the Tokyo Olympics next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Now, the direct-dora master Hiroyo Ikemura does not need a tee up even for the first shot</seg>
<seg id="2">Today's Caddy's best shot</seg>
<seg id="3">A 1W shot is not always a tee-up shot.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a so-called "straight-drag" technique that hits the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance with the second shot of a par 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">The recent 1W has the risk of the ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this often on the tee ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hiroyo Ikemura is waiting for his first victory on the tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the age of 24 in the seventh year of professionalism, despite being a small body with a height of 166 cm, he is currently 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).</seg>
<seg id="8">While being good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the early spring, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I'm thinking of doing a straight drive," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, I dropped a ball on the grass in the tee area, and sometimes I could shake off 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where big carry is required, we often use tee-ups, but we are making effective use of straight gadgets in holes with narrow sides.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It can be used in holes where the line of sight is downhill."</seg>
<seg id="13">Carry recorded 270 yd to 280 yd with a ballistic instrument.</seg>
<seg id="14">"So I don't need 3W. I think the caddy can be more comfortable with a direct drive than a 3W...".</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, the wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is UT with a loft of 17 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The tactics that surprised the tour companions were astonishing to hear from the gallery I saw.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to "swing the club level (horizontal)".</seg>
<seg id="19">"I can't fly straight down or down, even if I hit it with the upper. If it's a cut trajectory, it goes to the right. Originally I was doing a straight drama to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tee-up). With practice, the attack angle (angle of incidence of the club) also becomes gentler."</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and there is a risk of slicing, but "So you can erase the left side (does not turn to the left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">It's a professional technique that makes me scream, though I say it easily.</seg>

<seg id="2">Interview/Sentence/Yo Watanabe</seg>
<seg id="3">A drug for dementia that has been frustrated by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenging research and development.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility of being extremely mild and able to be left to forget.</seg>
<seg id="5">We interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki, Stroke Center, Kinki University Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia will not disappear</seg>
<seg id="7">――― There are long-awaited drugs for preventing or treating dementia. What is the current situation?</seg>
<seg id="8">From mild to severe Otsuki, everyone can become demented with increasing age.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years before a new drug for dementia is developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drug donepezil, which is often used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some overseas countries, and we cannot expect a remarkable cure effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, while deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to remarkable progress in the treatment of anti-cancer drugs, etc., people have become able to live longer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not something that can be solved by the person alone or his/her family, but it is necessary to create an environment in which the entire society can live in peace in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep things "forget"</seg>
<seg id="15">―――Is there a person who is prone to dementia and a person who is not prone to dementia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if Otsuki dementia is unavoidable, there is a possibility that the symptoms will be suppressed as much as possible, and the symptoms will be "forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to those who are prone to.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, people with metabolic syndrome are prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is considered as a lifestyle-related disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power also affects.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in some parts of the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food items that can be obtained with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas, and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">Neither gas nor electricity can be used, and it can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then, you end up with a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, leading to a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and sugars.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, he becomes poverty but becomes obese, and all he has to do is watch TV, and he will be incapacitated.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can occur in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who do not think about things and who do not work tend to have dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things that do not become metabolic syndrome.</seg>
