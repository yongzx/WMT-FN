<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">(Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!news</seg>
<seg id="3">Violations of the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">There have been increasing reports of accidents caused by mis-operation of the pedal, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to data from the National Police Agency in 2015, the number of accidents involving pedal missteps by age group was 1,080 for those aged 24 and under, exceeding 1,032 for those aged 75 and over.</seg>
<seg id="6">Missteps are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Would you like to take a look at your feet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you want to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no description of gender ratio or cause in the data, but unlike elderly people, who are often thought to be due to physical deterioration such as driving skills and reflexes, it is possible that young people accidentally make mistakes because they are distracted by other things such as music and conversation, or because they are wearing clothes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Women, in particular, choose high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, depending on the clothes of the day, and some people drive as they are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to change shoes, but there are many people who drive without thinking at all about the possibility of leading to danger.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels or sandals is against the Road Traffic Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is to "reliably operate the steering wheel, brakes and other controls" and the other is to "violate the obligation to drive safely" stipulated in Article 70, which stipulates that "driving that causes an accident and injures a person."</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, in the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a sentence in Article 12, "Do not wear slippers, hooks, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with driving operations, or wear footwear in a way that interferes with driving operations, and do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles).</seg>
<seg id="15">The same goes for each prefecture, which considers driving in "footwear that may interfere with driving operations" as a violation, even if it does not clearly state that it is a high heel.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then, why is driving in high heels dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">That's clear when you consider the basics of safely pedaling.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to operate the pedal safely, first fix the heel of the foot to the floor, place the foot so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the toe to the right with that as the fulcrum.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to secure the heel firmly so that it does not shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, with high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small, and it will always be blurred, and because the whole foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the foot that touches the pedal is also small, so it is difficult to step firmly, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is thought to lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also, most cars have floor carpets, but high heel heels are easy to get caught in this material, and when it comes to sudden braking, the heel gets caught and the pedal can not be stepped on, or the high heel can be taken off due to the time signature caught by the heel, and it can be stuck in the back of the pedal and can not be stepped on.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, there are cases where the heel gets stuck on the back of the pedal when you step on the pedal and the accelerator pedal does not return.</seg>

<seg id="4">Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka-fu, Yoshida Daichi Law Office, telephone: 06-6365-6038) and one other attorney applied.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nihon Onkyo Engineering Co., Ltd. is a manufacturer of roof tiles founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, under the trade name of Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., the company started its business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry of Awaji Island, in Seitan-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minami Awaji City).</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, he took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. through an absorption-type merger of Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd., and at the same time, he changed the current trade name and moved the head office to its current location.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, it established sales offices in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used in the past, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles are now 70 percent and Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi-gawara are 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has built a wide-ranging sales base centered in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roofing contractors, and posted annual sales of about 3.116 billion yen in the fiscal year ending December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the top manufacturer of roof tiles on Awaji Island, it was well known.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market after the Lehman Shock and the repeated damages from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to about 1345 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the profit side, in addition to a decline in profit margins due to the surge in fuel prices, the company faced a series of deficits due to excess interest-bearing liabilities associated with inventory burdens and capital expenditures, forcing it to face severe financing conditions.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, they tried to restructure their business by requesting financial institutions to ease repayment conditions for their loans, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions and the financial situation gradually became tight.</seg>
<seg id="14">After coming here, he was unable to support the project and gave up on continuing it, and this measure was taken this time.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the introduction of "Bishojo Collection", there is a sentence that "Fear and ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only because of their beauty at the opposite end", but it may be because of the contrast that the beautiful face is distorted and changed into the expression of resentment that harbors resentment ...</seg>

<seg id="11">In this way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugliness" are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" settled is good luck.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among his drawings of snakes are the 1965 series Hebi Shojo (Snake Girl) and Mora no Shojo (Small Girl).</seg>
<seg id="14">Generally speaking, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "snub woman" in the market.</seg>
<seg id="15">To put it in an immersive way, it could be called a "cool beauty" type ... ... that seems to be the commonality of the beautiful girls who appear in the painting.</seg>

<seg id="16">Kobayashi: while many young people yearn for the job of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers don't get the revenue they want.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who work part-time while producing and posting videos, and there are many creators whose family does not recognize the existence of YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide the hired creators with a salary and an environment for content creation.</seg>

<seg id="1">[The first half of the Bud Olympics Race] World Champion Kento Momota takes the lead!</seg>
<seg id="2">&lt;Men's Singles&gt; (Bud x Spi!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japan national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, a major badminton event in August, will participate in the China OP (Super 1000) starting from September 17 after completing a training camp in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, we will look back at the first half of the games from May to August, when the Olympic race for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and look at the men's singles for the middle game (September to December) (text / Badminton Magazine Editorial Department ).</seg>
<seg id="5">Badminton's Olympic Games, which began in May, digested the top four Super 500 or higher competitions in which the top players competed at the end of the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first half, Kento Momota, who won 2 out of 4 races, and Tiancheng Chou of Taiwan were probably the two who kept up the good performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momota won the world championship, Zhou Tianzhen won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the tournament where high points of the "world ranking point" directly connected to the Olympic race can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="8">Momota has also won the Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">The tournaments that have participated since May are the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/Result is 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number of top players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since there was only one World Championship in August, fatigue will not be much greater than during consecutive wars.</seg>
<seg id="12">Good results will be required in the midfield games, where the top tournaments will be held in succession after September.</seg>
<seg id="13">Taiwanese ace who is strong in series fights.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pay attention to the young people in Thailand!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tianzhen, who also won the top competitions of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to being physically strong, he is a player who does not suffer from consecutive battles.</seg>
<seg id="18">As the tournament continues, there will be no major problems with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the contrary, the high points earned in the first half would have made it easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to be played in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zhou Tianzhen had an impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but since the start of this year, he has been able to continue his good performance with an increased sense of stability on the playing surface.</seg>
<seg id="21">Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, is likely to be a more difficult opponent than ever.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other than these two players, Thailand's young ace Kantaphon and India's Sai Pranice B. produced results in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="23">And Anders Antonsen, who is struggling alone as a European force, is three players.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Cantafone did not advance to the finals in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, having finished in the best four in the two tournaments this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is still a rough surface, but the 20-year-old (21 on the 18th) who can rally on an equal footing with top athletes seems to have a great potential to make a leap in the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sai Pranise B. also took a step forward in India, where there are good singles players.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Barama, Pranoy H.s. and Srikanth Kidambi, who are behind with injuries, will also be catching up in the future, so India's post-midfield side will need to be cautious.</seg>

<seg id="1">New Charges for Mobile Phones: Hokkaido Shimbun</seg>
<seg id="2">With the enactment of the amended Telecommunications Business Law in October, mobile phone companies have launched new rate plans.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, they generally remained high.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last summer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room to cut prices by about 40 percent."despite heightened expectations for price cuts, price competition did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rakuten's full-fledged entry has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues to be a major factor.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is desirable for consumers to have an easy-to-use pricing system through fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amended law prohibits discounts on the set of terminal and telecommunications charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was because the communication fee was set to be expensive instead of selling the terminal fee at a low price.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to cut handsets by up to half.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days, so a "SIM lock" is attached to the terminal.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT Docomo will reduce the terminal fee to one-third of the maximum for its own line subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three companies appear to be continuing their "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has announced a policy requiring the immediate release of SIM locks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to take immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the maintenance of the telecommunications network, such as base stations, did not go as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a catalyst for the price cut competition, so it looks like a shrug.</seg>
<seg id="18">There may have been a sweetness in the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when or how much the service will start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to engage in business responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="21">The recent price revision was triggered by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga's remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Suga expressed dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it is okay at all."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, I do not think that "government-manufactured price cuts" will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before the government interferes with them.</seg>
<seg id="25">The price structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds the half price even though advertisements such as "maximum half price" are placed on terminals.</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies themselves should try to provide polite and easy-to-understand explanations so as not to mislead users.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was a black star start, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half caused a stir.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is a one-shot exit in the form of adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.</seg>

<seg id="14">As a result, the other person's head comes into contact with the other person's head, and it is shaped like a headbutt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Farrell was violently blown away and collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="16">The England players vehemently protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Players from both sides gathered at once, and it became an air of instantaneous touch.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill was red carded and exited.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with a bad look on his face, but some of the spectators who wanted to play fair were booed.</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 26, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) released for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals nationwide, including 1,455 public hospitals and the JRCS, that were judged to have "poor medical records."</seg>
<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and targeted four facilities: Awara Hospital of the National Hospital Organization in Awara City; Oda Hospital in Echizen Town; and Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town.</seg>
<seg id="3">4 hospitals subject to reorganization: "standards are strange"</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to curb medical expenses, which are swelling due to the aging of the population, it is necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">A full-scale review of reorganization and integration will be requested in October and a conclusion will be reached by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not compulsory, but local chiefs and residents are anticipating opposition due to fears that nearby hospitals will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at the same day's meeting.</seg>
<seg id="8">The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many of them had relatively few beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).</seg>
<seg id="10">The number of targets was the largest in Hokkaido with 54, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on data from fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) surveyed 1,455 public and public hospitals that can respond to the "high acute phase" for severe patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">By analyzing the results of nine treatments, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals are located "within 20 minutes by car", we judged the necessity of disclosing the name of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">The target hospitals will be asked to consider abolition or the transfer of some departments to other hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medical expenses will skyrocket in 25 years, when all baby boomers are 75 years old or older.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds nationwide from 1,246,000 in 2018 to 1,191,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are well placed and medical expenses are high, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation facilities that are in high need of the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regarding the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "community medical care plan" that specifies the number of beds necessary for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The entire country is divided into 339 zones, where municipalities and medical professionals are consulting, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious, making the debate difficult.</seg>

<seg id="3">Nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boar.</seg>
<seg id="4">The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the region, but meat and processed products can be distributed outside the region.</seg>

<seg id="8">Based on the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has designated "recommended areas for vaccination" for areas at high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefectures have created a vaccination program that summarizes the scope of vaccination, the timing of vaccination, the number of vaccinated vaccinators, and how to proceed. the program is confirmed by the ministry and approved for use at the governor's discretion.</seg>

<seg id="12">In principle, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, feces, etc. is restricted within the area.</seg>

<seg id="5">[Video] Keisuke Honda, were you actually at the game?</seg>
<seg id="6">The astonishing truth will be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Offer me, I don't need the money, but I need to play with a great team and a great teammate," Honda said after updating his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th.</seg>
<seg id="8">The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world-renowned club.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make such an epic request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?</seg>
<seg id="10">It all started with an article on the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an article entitled "Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of an injury crisis", five currently available unaffiliated players were picked up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among the players Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonnie were Honda's names.</seg>
<seg id="13">United are currently in a state of emergency with a number of injuries including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailly, FW Antony Marcial and FW Marcus Rushford.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Red Devils, led by Ole Gunnar Surchar, were forced to make a difficult start in the league with two wins and 22 defeats.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force to take advantage of.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative player rather than a striker can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling".</seg>
<seg id="17">Nine goals in 18 appearances for Melbourne Victory is a "solid record", but "33-year-old Honda needs to get the full attention away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team".</seg>
<seg id="18">Will Honda's approach really bear fruit?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is also worth noting whether United will make a move for the veteran who has publicly stated that his goal is to participate in the Tokyo Olympics next year.</seg>

<seg id="9">In early spring, he opened his eyes and said, "I couldn't shoot with a spoon (3W), so I thought about doing a direct dora."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, he drops the ball on the turf of Tiarea and sometimes shakes off 1W without thinking.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where big carry is required, tie-ups are often used, but direct dolls are effectively utilized in narrow halls on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="12">It can be used in halls where the eyes are down.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ballistic instruments recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why I don't need 3W, and the caddie can feel more secure with a direct dora than with 3W ...</seg>
<seg id="15">From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddie bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is Loft 17 Degrees UT.</seg>
<seg id="17">The method of fighting that surprises even the tour companions is also glad to hear the admiration leaking from the gallery you saw.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to swing the club to the level (horizontal).</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if you hit it with a down blow or an upper, it doesn't fly straight.if it's a cut trajectory, it goes to the right.originally I was doing a direct doll to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of tie-up).this practice also makes the attack angle (club incidence angle) moderate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and carries the risk of slicing, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left)".</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a professional technique that makes you unintentional.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetfulness"?</seg>
<seg id="2">Interview and text by Yo Watanabe</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a drug for dementia that has been frustrated by the R&amp;D efforts of major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the extent that it is extremely mild and forgetful.</seg>
<seg id="5">We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of Kindai University Hospital's Stroke Center.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia won't go away.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is the current state of dementia prevention and treatment?</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the degree varies from mild to severe, dementia can occur when everyone gets older.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drug donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is not covered by insurance in some countries, so it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to remarkable advances in the treatment of anticancer drugs, etc.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not something that can be solved by individuals or families alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep it to the level of 'obliviousness'</seg>
<seg id="15">Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become dementia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if it is inevitable that you will get Otsuki dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep it to the level of "obliviousness".</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered to be a lifestyle-related disease, and people who are prone to it tend to have it.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to develop dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as a lifestyle-related disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power also affects the economy.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the United States, there are regions that distribute food tickets to the poor, but the foods that can be obtained with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">It can be used by people who can't use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they can't cook in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="24">This leads to a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, and a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, I became poor but obese, and all I had to do was stare at the TV, and my body became crippled.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can happen in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who don't think about things and don't work tend to get dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books on a daily basis and think about things that do not become metabolic.</seg>
