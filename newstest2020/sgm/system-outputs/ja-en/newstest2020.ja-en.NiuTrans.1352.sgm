<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Accidents of young people stepping on the wrong pedal occur frequently (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="3">Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">There has been an increase in reports of accidents caused by misoperation, such as stepping on a pedal, attracting attention, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to 2015 National Police Agency data, the most common number of accidents occurred in 1080 cases under the age of 24, surpassing 1032 cases over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not common for the elderly to make mistakes, and it is important to call attention to young people in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you take the fashion of your feet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you take safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no description of the gender ratio or cause in this data, unlike the elderly, who are often thought to be due to physical decline such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may make careless mistakes due to being distracted by other things such as music and conversation, or make mistakes due to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules, and some people drive as they are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to change clothes, but many people drive without any bad feeling without thinking about the possibility that it will lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels and sandals is a violation of the Road Traffic Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">The first is Article 70, "Violation of Safe Driving Obligations," which stipulates that "the steering wheel, brake and other operations must be operated reliably" and "the driver must not drive in a way that causes an accident and causes harm to others."</seg>
<seg id="14">The other is Article 71, "Violation of Public Safety Commission compliance matters," which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set out by each prefectural public safety committee. For example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations states, "Do not drive a vehicle (except for light vehicles) by wearing geta, slippers, tsukkake, high heels or other footwear that may interfere with driving operation, or by wearing footwear in a way that interferes with driving operation."</seg>
<seg id="15">The purpose of each prefecture is the same, even if it does not clearly state high heels, to consider driving with "footwear that may interfere with the operation" as a violation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So why is driving in high heels so dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">This is obvious when you consider the basics of safe pedal operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe and reliable pedal operation, the heel of the foot is first fixed to the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the tip of the foot is tilted to the right using it as a fulcrum.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep the heel firmly fixed so that it does not blur.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels, the area where the heel is ground on the floor is small, so it always blurs, and because the whole foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area where the foot is ground on the pedal is also small, making it difficult to step firmly and make fine adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is thought to lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material makes it easy for the heel of the high heel to get caught, and when the heel suddenly breaks, the pedal can not be stepped on, or when the heel is caught, the high heel can be taken off and it can not be stepped on because it is stuck in the back of the pedal.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, when stepping on the pedal and returning it, the heel got caught on the back of the pedal, and the accelerator pedal did not return.</seg>

<seg id="3">Seoul held a torch ignition event to commemorate the National Sports Festival at 6: 30 a.m. on the 26th at the helicopter landing site of the Dokdo Guard in Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the first time in 15 years that the torch of the National Sports Festival has been ignited on Dokdo since the 85th National Sports Festival was held in Chungbuk in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following a kite flying performance to pray for peace, Kim Seong-hwan, vice chairman of Seoul City Council, read out the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vice Chairman Kim said, "I stood on Dokdo Island to remember the past 99 years of the National Sports Festival and to honor the will of the people to commit suicide," adding, "100 years ago, our people made a shining history of the March 1st movement and the establishment of the government of the Republic of Korea, and I would like to add 100 years of history of the National Sports Festival to that history."</seg>

<seg id="2">SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Borisov, who is on an official visit to South Korea, at Cheongwadae (presidential office) on the 27th to discuss measures to expand substantial cooperation between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first visit by a Bulgarian prime minister to South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Moon welcomed his visit to South Korea ahead of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year, and highly praised Prime Minister Borisov's leadership in leading the development of Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The two leaders appreciated the continued increase in trade and investment between the two countries even as protectionism expanded worldwide, and agreed that they would continue to work together to expand economic cooperation in the future.</seg>
<seg id="6">President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy of granting "strategic investor" status to Korean companies, and said he hoped this would encourage Korean companies to invest in Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also stressed that South Korea can be the best partner for Bulgaria as Bulgaria promotes the introduction of nuclear power plants and the modernization of its national defense, and called for interest and cooperation so that Korean companies can participate in the Bulgarian government's order for nuclear power plants and the promotion of the defense industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the two leaders agreed to strengthen future-oriented cooperation in the fields of batteries and automotive parts for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The slump in the housing market and repeated damage caused by the earthquake also affected "consumers moving away from tiled roofs"</seg>
<seg id="3">Kindai Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative: Fukuhara Kozo, 44 employees) filed for quasi-bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30th.</seg>
<seg id="4">The application agent is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka, Daichi Yoshida Law Firm, 06-6365-6038) and one other person.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961 as a tile manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, he started his business as an Ibushi tile manufacturer, a local industry on Awaji Island, in Seidan-cho, Mihara-gun (now Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, the company absorbed Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd., took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and moved its head office to its current location after changing its current trade name.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita and Miyazaki, and the current system was established. In the past, Ibushi tiles were mainly used, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat tiles are now produced at 70% and Japanese tiles such as Ibushi tiles are produced at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company has built a wide range of sales bases, mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies, and recorded annual sales of approximately 3.16 billion yen for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was well known as the top tile manufacturer on Awaji Island.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, during this period, the housing market has been sluggish since the Lehman Shock, as well as consumers moving away from tiled roofs due to repeated damage such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, and demand has been sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 have fallen to about 1.345 billion yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the profit side, in addition to a decline in profit margins due to a surge in fuel prices, the company was forced to face a series of losses due to excessive interest-bearing debt due to inventory burdens and capital investment, forcing it to face severe financial conditions.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, they were trying to rebuild their business by asking financial institutions to relax the conditions for repayment of their debts, but there were no signs of recovery in their business conditions, and their financial position was gradually tight.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I came here, I couldn't support them, so I gave up continuing my business, and this measure was taken.</seg>
<seg id="15">The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mysterious beauty and shadowy facial expressions have something in common?</seg>
<seg id="4">"Umezu Kazuo: Beautiful Girl Collection" (Genkosha), which focuses on the beautiful girls drawn by Umezu Kazuo, who has produced many works since the 1950s and is known as a leading expert in "horror manga", was released in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">When I pick it up and look at it, I realize once again the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" in Kazuo Umezu's work.</seg>
<seg id="6">[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?</seg>
<seg id="7">Beautiful girls in Kazuo Umezu's work (5 photos)</seg>
<seg id="8">In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection", there was a sentence that said, "Fear, ugliness, and shocking scenes and developments in the story stand out only because of the beauty of the girls at the opposite end of the story", but "fear" may stand out more because of the contrast in which the beautiful faces are distorted and the expression of resentment with a grudge changes...</seg>
<seg id="9">The keyword "snake" appears in many of Kazuo Umezu's works, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being regarded as "creepy creatures" by the viewer and feeling "beautiful" by some people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people in the world like reptiles, while others just don't like them.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, depending on the viewer's sensibility, "snake" may be a creature where "beauty" and "ugliness" are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="12">This creature has been worshipped as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" lived is said to be auspicious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Umezu's works based on the snake include "Serpent Girl" and "Madara no Shojo" from the 1965 "Mama ga Kowai!" series.</seg>
<seg id="14">In most cases, "serpent woman" is a beautiful woman with a shadow.</seg>
<seg id="15">To put it bluntly, it can be said that they are "cool beauty" types... I feel that that is what the beautiful girls who appear in Umezu's works have in common.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among them, "Orochi", the main character of "Orochi", which has been serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be one of the representative of Umezu's works, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, she goes to a deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with mysterious power somehow reminds me of "Snake".</seg>

<seg id="1">"The real culprit" for drone attack on Saudi oil facility (Friday) - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Iranian drone used in this bombing, the Ababir, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing the crashed US drone," he said.</seg>
<seg id="3">It can be manufactured at a low price and has a range of about 1000 km.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of our strengths is that it flies low, so it's hard to get caught by radar, "says Toru Yokota, a news photographer.</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 14th, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, were bombed by 10 military drones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Soon after, the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group, issued a statement of guilt.</seg>
<seg id="7">"There is no doubt that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is behind the Houthis. Iran cannot allow its rival Saudi Arabia to make money from crude oil in a situation where it cannot export crude oil. The aim is to let the international community know that if Iran continues to impose an embargo on crude oil, it will cause corresponding pain," says Sugawara, an international political analyst.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the wake of the bombing, as much as half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production was shut down, and oil prices skyrocketed by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="9">As it is, some say the oil shock will come back.</seg>
<seg id="10">"As long as Trump has pledged to withdraw US troops from the Middle East, he wants to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until next year's election is over. With that in mind, Iran will continue to bomb drones under the cover of the Houthis. However, the US will not be able to put up with it forever. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future," says Sugawara.</seg>

<seg id="4">A YouTuber who is now extremely popular, mainly among young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not uncommon for companies to use them to advertise their products, but some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber Recruitment," in which they hire them as regular employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereafter referred to as DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).</seg>
<seg id="7">What does "hiring a YouTuber" mean?</seg>
<seg id="8">We spoke with Kobayashi Yuki, CEO of DmMiX and representative of Staff First, a subsidiary that actually hired YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="9">I want to support young people who are working hard to hire YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="10">How does "YouTuber Recruitment" work in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="11">Kobayashi Yuki (hereafter referred to as Kobayashi): The profession of YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also at the top of the list of jobs that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people who are aiming for it will continue to increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the past, we have hired and supported young people who are chasing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, "YouTuber Recruitment" is about hiring and supporting young people who are chasing their dream of becoming a YouTuber.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is an image that YouTubers are individuals who voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to hire them?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the job of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers are not able to make as much money as they thought.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who do not have their families recognize them as YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide hired creators with a salary and an environment for content creation.</seg>
<seg id="19">At first, we are thinking of supporting our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which inevitably puts you in an unstable position.</seg>

<seg id="11">"I forgot my hatred and returned it with compassion and kindness. I felt the origin of the piety and kindness of the people of Fukui," says Soda.</seg>
<seg id="12">Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara as soon as she arrived, and completed the story "Meoto Oni", in which a kind-hearted demon couple and a boy appear.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since June, he has made use of his main job to draw 10 scenes with warm watercolors, and the materials for the picture book have been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the cover of the picture book will be made of Japanese paper using Echizen Japanese paper, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will be an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper by reading it.</seg>
<seg id="16">The goal of the donation is 850,000 yen for the publication of 600 copies.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deadline is until October 25th.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soda said, "The heart of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, can be proud of all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="19">I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that has been passed down through the generations to children through picture books. "</seg>

<seg id="3">From 8% to 10% On the 28th, the last weekend before the consumption tax increase, home appliance stores and supermarkets in Okayama Prefecture were visited one after another by families who were buying in the rush.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a home center that has a special store for bulk purchases, and a suit store that sells winter clothing ahead of schedule, and each store is focusing on sales.</seg>
<seg id="5">At Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Ekimae Town, Kita-ku, Okayama), there will be a limited time special price sale until the 30th.</seg>
<seg id="6">A man (37) from the city who came to the store in search of a refrigerator said, "Even though it is 2%, you can't overlook the difference when it comes to expensive items."</seg>

<seg id="2">Jürgen Klopp, winner of the best manager award for "The Best", looked back on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the many statements that surprised the public was about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who will be his biggest rival for the Premier League title.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neymar's best friend Aves says: "His happiness is still in Barça..."</seg>
<seg id="5">After the award ceremony for "The Best", the German commander claimed, "I never imagined it would be so great. I am very happy and proud to have won this award. It's been a great few days for me. Thanks to my players, I was able to win the award. The most important thing is the team."</seg>
<seg id="6">Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said, "I respect him very much," and said, "What can I say about him? He's won a lot of titles. The style his team plays is extraordinary. He's the best manager I've ever played against. It's one honor to be nominated with him and be able to compete for the award."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also mentioned manager Pochettino and Tottenham.</seg>
<seg id="8">"His last year was incredibly great. In many cases, if he didn't win the title, people wouldn't remember him. He was building the team little by little and playing in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="9">Klopp commented without hesitation about the best moments of 2019: "It's a reversal against (CL) Barcelona. A lot of experts and myself wouldn't have bet a centimeter on us. 3-0 behind a team with Messi and Suárez... that's like a death sentence. We had a small chance and were able to make it a thing. I couldn't believe it. When I look back, I might be able to say we won the CL. This game will be remembered by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked a more personal question at the end, Klopp concluded: "When I congratulated them on winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. This time it didn't happen. I don't like getting drunk because I'm a person with a self-control obsession. I congratulated them on winning the CL very modestly. I remember everything. If I had everyone lined up in front of me, I might be able to identify all the people I saw from the bus."</seg>

<seg id="3">The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, a project of the Marine Industry Cluster Council, including Shizuoka City, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura Shrimp, which is thought to have been born during this spring / summer spawning season, on the seabed at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people involved hope it will lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The photo was taken near the seabed about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of Kanbara district, Shimizu-ku.</seg>
<seg id="6">A total of 300 animals were confirmed in 17 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conventional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea during the day "form a certain amount of groups on the seabed" has been reconfirmed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The adult is about 40 millimeters long, and the individual shown is about 23 millimeters long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spawning season was identified by matching it with seasonal data from the caught sakura shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="10">For detailed analysis, Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka College of Industrial Science and Technology, which make up the team, will be asked.</seg>

<seg id="1">[First half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Momota Kento and doing well Zhou Tian Cheng lead one step!</seg>
<seg id="2">&lt; Men's singles &gt; (Bud x Spi!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japan national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Basel, Switzerland), a big badminton event held in August, will finish their training camp in early September and participate in the China OP (Changzhou / Super 1000), which starts on the 17th.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, we look back on the first half of the race from May to August, when the Olympic race for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and look at the men's singles for the middle of the race (September to December) (Text / Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).</seg>
<seg id="5">The badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested the four top tournaments (Super 500 or higher) in which the top players competed at the end of the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="6">Momota Kento, who won 2 out of 4 tournaments, and Taiwan's Cho Tien Cheng were the two players who kept doing well in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momota won the world championship and Zhou Tian Cheng won the Indonesian OP (S1000), which is directly linked to the Olympic race, and won the high points of "world ranking points".</seg>
<seg id="8">Momota also won the Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">Since May, he has participated in four tournaments: the group Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesian OP (July / results are 16 strong), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.</seg>
<seg id="11">August was only one world championship tournament, so the fatigue will not be as great as it was during the series.</seg>
<seg id="12">A good result is required in the middle of a series of top tournaments since September.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is a Taiwanese ace who is strong in a series of battles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Attention is also paid to young people in Thailand!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tian Cheng, who also won the top tournaments in Indonesia and Thailand (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September, and won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a player who has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from a series of matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the tournament continues, there will be no major problems with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather, the high points in the first half would have made it easier for them to adjust the schedule for the tournament they will participate in in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">Until last year, Zhou Tian Cheng had the impression that he was lacking in explosive power, but this year, with more stability on the playing side, he has been able to continue his good results.</seg>
<seg id="21">Momota, ranked number one in the world, is likely to be a more troublesome opponent than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to these two players, young Thai ace Cantafon and India's Sai Pranice B. had results in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="23">Anders Anton Sen, who is struggling alone as a member of the European team, is the three players.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Cantafon have not reached the final in the top tournaments, they have gained strength to advance to the top, finishing in the top 4 in two tournaments this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although there is still a rough side, the 20 year old (21 years old on the 18th), who is now able to rally on an equal footing with the top players, seems to have great potential to make a leap forward in the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sai Pranice B. also took a step out of India, where there are good singles players.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Barama, Pranoi H.S. and Srikans Kidambi, who have been delayed due to injury, will also be catching up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian team after the middle game.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October, a new fee plan for mobile phone companies has been announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it remained generally high.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said last summer that there was "room for a 40% reduction" and there was no price competition, even though expectations for a price reduction had been raised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues to be a major factor.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is desirable for consumers to have a fee structure that is easy to use through fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revised law prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is because instead of selling the device at a low price, the communication fee was set to be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">SOFTBANK and KDDI (a u) have announced plans to reduce the price of terminals by up to half.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies have a "SIM lock" on their terminals that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT Docomo will reduce the cost of terminals by up to a third only for subscribers of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three companies appear to be continuing to "encircle" to prevent transfers to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has announced that it will require the immediate release of the SIM lock.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to respond as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the development of communication networks, such as base stations, did not go as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a catalyst for price reduction competition, so it was a great outfit.</seg>
<seg id="18">I think there was a sweetness in the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when or how much the service will start.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.</seg>
<seg id="21">The revision of the fee was triggered by remarks made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.</seg>
<seg id="22">Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees for the three companies, saying, "I think competition is going to start in the future. I don't think it's going to be as good as it is."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is hard to believe that "government-made price cuts" will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pricing structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention, saying that even though the device is advertised as "up to half the price", there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half the price.</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies themselves must try to explain carefully and in an easy-to-understand manner so as not to cause misunderstandings among users.</seg>

<seg id="3">At the Rugby World Cup in Japan on the 26th, the United States, the last of the 20 countries to play in the tournament, lost 7-45 to England.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a black star start, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half caused a stir.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was sent off one shot in the form of a shoulder tackle on the opponent's face.</seg>
<seg id="6">The actual scene has been released in the overseas media with a video, and the former England player has also complained that it is "insulting and despicable play" and "not what can be called a tackle".</seg>
<seg id="7">[VIDEO] "Insult and despicable play" ripples overseas!</seg>
<seg id="8">One shot sent off, both players were in a disturbance... The actual moment of the "face danger tackle" played by the US national team Quill</seg>
<seg id="9">The passionate fighting spirit has crossed the line.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was 29 minutes into the second half when they were 0-38.</seg>
<seg id="11">Deep in the opposition, England captain Farrell lost his balance a bit when he caught his side's pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Quill who went to tackle this.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, he woke up his upper body, not from the waist down, and hit his upper body hard.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the opponent's head and head come into contact, and it is shaped like a headbutt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Farrell was blown away hard and fell down.</seg>
<seg id="16">England players protest hard as they try to push Quill into a play that clearly lacks legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Players from both sides gathered at once, creating an instant atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with a bad face, but was booed in part by the crowd calling for fair play.</seg>
<seg id="20">The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby team, featured the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: US player sent off for despicable play, England win comfortably".</seg>
<seg id="21">"Kill was sent off for a despicable shoulder charge to the face of England star Farrell," the report said. "It was almost a brawl between the two players."</seg>
<seg id="22">The article features comments from former England player and commentator Ugo Monya.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's insulting, it's despicable. It's not what you can call a tackle. It's a despicable play," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United States, who lacked one player in the game, managed to escape a complete loss with a bold try in the 81st minute.</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in Japan, including 1455 public hospitals and the JRCS, that it judged to have "poor medical results".</seg>
<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) verified the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara, Mikuni Hospital in Sakai, Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho, Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama-cho.</seg>
<seg id="3">4 hospitals subject to reorganization 'standards are strange'</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to control the cost of medical care, which is expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing areas, so the government decided to take an unusual action.</seg>
<seg id="5">In October, the hospital will also request a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration, and a conclusion will be reached by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although there is no force, there is expected to be a backlash from local chiefs and residents due to concerns that nearby hospitals will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at a meeting on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many hospitals had relatively few beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">By prefecture, the percentage was higher in the order of Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%).</seg>
<seg id="10">The number of targets was the largest in Hokkaido, 54, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on data from the 2017 academic year, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) conducted a survey of 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to the "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">They analyzed the results of nine medical care items, including cancer and emergency medical care, as well as whether competing hospitals were within 20 minutes by car, and determined the need to publish the name of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">The target hospitals will be asked to consider abolishing them or moving some departments to other hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cost of health care will skyrocket in 2015, when all baby boomers will be 75 years old or older.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1.46,000 beds nationwide (2018) to 1.191,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, there are many beds in the "advanced acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are carefully assigned and medical expenses are incurred, but there is a shortage of beds for rehabilitation, which is in high need for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regarding the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture has developed a "community medical plan" that sets out the number of beds required for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The whole country has been divided into 339 areas, and local governments and medical officials are in talks, but many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, making it difficult to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) hopes to revitalize discussions by publishing the names of hospitals with poor performance.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on the 27th an amendment to its quarantine guidelines that would allow preventive vaccination of raised pigs, which is not currently permitted, in order to prevent the spread of swine cholera, an infectious disease in livestock.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.</seg>
<seg id="4">The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="5">After public comments to the general public (open call for opinions), the process is expected to be completed as early as October.</seg>
<seg id="6">By using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat and other products outside the region, the country will no longer be a "clean country" that had been recognized by international organizations, which could affect pork exports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the outbreak last September, Japan's status as a clean country has been temporarily on hold.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) has set up a "recommended vaccination area" for areas at high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, based on the opinions of experts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with the vaccination, and the use will be approved at the governor's discretion after receiving confirmation from the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures listed as recommended areas for implantation are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and make a decision again.</seg>
<seg id="12">In principle, the movement of implanted pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excrement is restricted to the area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meat and processed products are not covered based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and are effectively allowed to be distributed outside the region.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order not to spread the virus, we will thoroughly dispose of food waste.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are also working to prevent reputational damage by appealing for the safety of implanted pigs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proposed amendment to the guidelines was finalized at a meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Quarantine Control Headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the future, opinions and public comments will be made to the prefectural government until October 7th, and the new quarantine control guidelines will be enforced.</seg>

<seg id="6">the amazing truth is revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th, made a public approach to one club, saying, "Give me an offer. I don't need any money, but I need to play with a great team or a great teammate."</seg>
<seg id="8">The person who sent the "reverse offer" was the world famous Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make such a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?</seg>
<seg id="10">It all started with an article in the Australian edition of Fox Sports, which was published on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an article titled "Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the midst of a series of injuries", five independent players currently available for acquisition were picked up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honda was also named among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonnie.</seg>
<seg id="13">United are currently in a state of emergency with a series of injuries, including midfielder Paul popoba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bayley, forward Antony Martial and forward Marcus rashford.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "Red Demons", led by Ole Gunner Soulchard, have had a difficult start to the league with 2 wins and 22 losses, and are facing challenges in the quality of their front line.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honda was named by the Australian media as a new candidate for the team.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the article, "Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, strictly speaking, could fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling."</seg>
<seg id="17">9 points in 18 games for Melbourne Victory is a "solid record", but it has also been pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his entertainment of managing the Cambodian national team and get full attention".</seg>
<seg id="18">Will Honda's approach come to fruition?</seg>
<seg id="19">It will also be interesting to see United move on for the veteran, who has announced his goal of competing in next year's Tokyo Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry) announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 Pokétalk portable translators at stores in Hamamatsu City, a project to lend free of charge to member offices.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the first time in Japan that the translator has been deployed intensively in the same area, and it is attracting attention as to whether it will lead to an improvement in the response of inbound tourists.</seg>
<seg id="5">The breakdown of lenders is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities and 134 others.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city accounts for 60% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have also started displaying the destination of the loan to the map app "Google Maps", so that they can see the location of "stores that are compatible with foreign languages" on their smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="8">It can be accessed from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does Ikemura Hiroyo, who is now a master of direct drama, need to tie up the first shot?</seg>
<seg id="2">today's caddie's best shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">A 1W shot is not necessarily something to tie up and hit.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a technique called "direct drama" in which you hit the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance with the second shot of the par-5.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent 1W games, there is a risk of the ball falling due to the large head volume, but some players practice this frequently on the tee ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for his first victory on the tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a professional, is 166cm tall, but is currently 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).</seg>
<seg id="8">While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.</seg>
<seg id="9">In early spring, he opened his eyes, saying, "I couldn't shoot the spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try a direct drama."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, he sometimes drops the ball on the grass of Tieria and shakes off the 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where a big carry is required, a lot of tie-ups are used, but both sides make effective use of direct drama in narrow holes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"You can use it in a hall where your eyes are down," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ballistics instrument recorded 270 yd to 280 yd on the carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"That's why I don't need a 3W. My caddie is more secure with a direct drama than a 3W..."</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood has only 1W in his caddie bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.</seg>
<seg id="17">The tactics that surprise even the tour friends are also happy with the exclamation that leaks from the gallery they see.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to "shake the club to a level (horizontal)".</seg>
<seg id="19">"Whether you hit it with a downblow or an upper, it doesn't fly straight. If it's a cut track, it goes to the right. Originally, I used to do a direct drama to straighten the swing of a 1W shot (when tie-up). This practice also slows the attack angle (angle of incident at the club)."</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and there is a risk of slicing, but "that's why the left side can be erased (it doesn't turn left)".</seg>
<seg id="21">It's a professional skill that makes you excited, even though it's easy to say.</seg>

<seg id="9">However, it is still thought it will take more than 20 years for a new dementia drug to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Donepezil, a drug often used in Japan, is already no longer covered by insurance in some countries overseas, so it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to remarkable advances in the treatment of anticancer drugs, and people are now able to live longer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not something that can be solved by oneself or one's family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep it to the level of "forgetting things"</seg>
<seg id="15">Is there anyone who is more likely to get dementia or less likely to get dementia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if it is inevitable that you will get Otsuki dementia, there is a possibility that you will be able to keep the symptoms as low as possible and keep them to the level of "forgetting things".</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and it tends to be more common in people who are more likely to develop it.</seg>
<seg id="18">First of all, people with metabolites are more likely to get dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power also affects.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the United States, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but the food you get with food tickets is frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is available to people living in an environment where they can't use gas or electricity and can't cook in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then you end up with a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, and you end up living a life that is biased towards lipids and carbohydrates.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, they become poor but obese, and the only thing they do is watch TV, and they become disabled.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation could be the case in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who do not think about things or work are also more likely to get dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis, not to become a metabolite.</seg>
