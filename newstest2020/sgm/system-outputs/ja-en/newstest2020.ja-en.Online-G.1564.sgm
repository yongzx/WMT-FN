<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Many accidents happen when young people tread the wrong pedal(Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="3">Violation of road traffic law</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a big mistake to think that it is only the problem of the elderly driver though the news of the accident by misoperation such as the mistake of the pedal is noticed more.</seg>
<seg id="5">The number of mistakes in pedals by age (2015 data from the National Police Agency) shows that the largest number of incidents are 24 years old or younger (1080) and more than 75 years old (1032).</seg>
<seg id="6">It is important to call attention to young people as well, as mistakes are not often made by the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you want to take your foot off the gas?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you take safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no description of the male-female ratio or cause in this data, but unlike the elderly people, who are often thought to suffer from a decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexes, the younger generation may be distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and may make mistakes or make mistakes in their clothes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Women, in particular, choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mules and a variety of shoes depending on their day's attire.</seg>
<seg id="11">While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, and it is troublesome to change shoes, some people do not think at all about the possibility that it will lead to danger, and many people are driving without ill will.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels and sandals is against the road traffic law.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is the"violation of the duty of safe driving " in Article 70, which stipulates that"operation of steering wheel, brake and other operations must be ensured"and that" operation should not be carried out to cause an accident and harm a person."</seg>
<seg id="14">The other is in violation of Article 71 of the Public Safety Commission, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural Public Safety Commission, and in accordance with Article 12 of the ordinance for the enforcement of the Miyazaki prefecture road traffic law, for example, " wearing slippers, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with the operation of the (excluding light vehicles.Do not drive). "I'm not going to do that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Each prefecture has the same principle of"footwear that may interfere with driving operation"even if it does not specify high heels.</seg>
<seg id="16">So why is driving in high heels dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">It's obvious, given the basics of safely pedalling.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal,and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the toe as a fulcrum to the right.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels, the heel ground to the floor is small, and it is always wobbly and blurry, and because the entire foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the toe that is grounded to the pedal is also small, and it is difficult to stagger firmly, and fine adjustment is made.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is thought to lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch heels of high heels, such as a sudden brake when the heel is caught and the pedal is not depressed, the high heel is removed to the beat that the heel has been caught, and there is no time to step on the back of the pedals. it is also the case that it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, there is also a case that when you step on the pedal and return, the heel is caught behind the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is not returned.</seg>

<seg id="2">１０The new tariff plan of the mobile phone company with the revised telecommunications business law enforcement of the month has been issued.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it became a high stop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "there is room for a reduction of about four percent", and price competition did not occur despite expectations for a price reduction.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is a big factor that the full-fledged entry of Rakuten has become a postponement, and the oligopoly state of the major three companies continues.</seg>
<seg id="6">For consumers, it is desirable to have a fee structure that is easy to use by fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">Want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amended law prohibits a set discount on handset charges and communications charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead of selling the terminal, it was set that the communication fee becomes more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI (AU) have announced plans to cut their terminals by half.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies can not use other lines for long range days "SIM lock" is the mechanism that takes on the terminal.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT DOCOMO will target only subscribers of its own line terminal charge to a maximum of three minutes of １。</seg>
<seg id="13">３ the company appears to continue the"enclosure" to prevent the transfer to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The policy of the Ministry of internal affairs and Communications is to require the immediate release of SIM locks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies need to respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement is because the improvement of the communication network such as the base station did not proceed as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be the trigger for the price cut competition, but it was a shoulder-shrug.</seg>
<seg id="18">There was a sweetness of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when the full-scale service will start or how much it will cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also a great way to learn about the history and culture of the city.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Suga said about the new rates of three companies,"I think the competition will start from now on.I don't think it's good at all,"he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, I do not think that"official price cuts"will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are exposed to the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fee structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency has called attention to the case that the consumer's burden is more than half the price, even though the terminal is advertising such as"the maximum becomes half the price".</seg>
<seg id="27">The company must try to provide a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so as not to create misunderstandings among users.</seg>

<seg id="3">1W shots don't necessarily tee up and hit.</seg>
<seg id="4">When you want to get away with hitting the par-5 2nd hole, you have to hit the ball on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="5">The recent 1W-per-cent increase in head volume also puts the risk of the ball falling, but some players have been more active on the field.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is kaniyo Ikemura who awaits the first victory of the tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 7-year-old, who is 24 years old, is 166cm tall and short but currently in 7th place in the driving distance category (averaging 304.02 y).</seg>
<seg id="8">While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairways.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the early spring, he said,"I thought that the shot of the spoon (3W) was bad, so I decided to try straight Dora."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, he dropped the ball onto tierrier's turf,and sometimes he would swing 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the case where big carry is required, we use a lot of teapup, but both sides have effectively utilized straight Dora in such a narrow hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"You can use it in a hall where the eyes are falling down," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ballistic instrument records 270yd-280yd in carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"That'S why 3W is not needed.Caddy says he's more relieved than 3W ...  he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">From the"Japan Tour Championship"on May 6, Wood in the Caddy bag only 1W.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 2nd longest club is Loft 17 UT.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's not the first time the pair have been spotted together on tour together.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to shake the club to the level (horizontally).</seg>
<seg id="19">"Even if you blow down or hit it with an uppercut, it does not fly straight.It's a cut trajectory and goes right.Originally I was doing a straight Dora to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of the teapot).The attack angle (the club's angle of incidence) will also be gradual in this practice."</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and there is a risk of a slice, but"so the left side can be turned off (it does not turn left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">I can't tell you...It is a professional technique that comes up unexpectedly.</seg>
