<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Many incidents of young people stepping on the wrong pedal (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="3">Violation of the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">Reports of accidents due to wrong operation such as stepping on the wrong pedal are increasing and attracting attention, but it is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the number of accidental pedaling accidents by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the most common age group was 1080 accidents involving people under the age of 24, with more than 1,032 accidents involving people aged 75 or older.</seg>
<seg id="6">Missteps are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">You want to dress your feet up?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you want to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no description of the gender ratio or the cause in this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to physical deterioration such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may inadvertently make mistakes due to being distracted by other things such as music and conversation, or may make mistakes due to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and drive as they are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some people say that it is troublesome to change shoes knowing that they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility of danger at all and drive without bad intentions.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels or sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is "the reliable operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations" and Article 70 "violation of the duty of safe driving" which stipulates that "the driver shall not drive in a manner that causes an accident and injures a person."</seg>
<seg id="14">The other is Article 71, 'violation of the matters to be observed by the Public Safety Commission,' which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural Public Safety Commission, and for example, in the Bylaws for Enforcement of the Road Traffic Law of Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a sentence in Article 12, 'Do not drive a vehicle (except for light vehicles) wearing geta, slippers, tsukkake, high heels or other footwear that may interfere with driving operation, or wearing footwear in a manner that interferes with driving operation.'</seg>
<seg id="15">Each prefecture has the same intention to regard driving with "footwear that may interfere with driving operation" as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.</seg>
<seg id="16">So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?</seg>
<seg id="17">That's obvious when you consider the basics of pedaling safely.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe and secure pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot to the floor, place the foot so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, use it as a fulcrum and tilt the foot to the right.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep the heel firmly fixed so that it does not shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, with high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small and it is always wobbly, and because the whole foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the foot that touches the pedal is also small and it is difficult to step firmly, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is considered to lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also, most cars have a floor carpet, but the heel of the high heel is easily caught in this material, and in the case of sudden braking, the heel is caught and the pedal can not step on, or the high heel is taken off at the time when the heel is caught, and it gets caught in the back of the pedal and becomes impossible to step on.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, there are cases where, when returning after stepping on the pedal, the heel gets caught on the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal does not return.</seg>

<seg id="2">The torch announcing the 100th National Sports Festival (National Sports Festival) was ignited in Dokdo (Japanese name: Takeshima), the easternmost island of the Republic of Korea.</seg>
<seg id="3">Seoul held a torch-lighting ceremony to commemorate the National Sports Festival at 6:30 a.m. on June 26 at the helicopter landing site of the Dokdo Guard in Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first time in 15 years that the Olympic flame has been lit in Dokdo since the 85th Games held in Chungbuk in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following a kite-flying performance to pray for peace, Kim Sung-hwan, vice-chairman of the Seoul City Council, read out the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vice-chairperson Kim said, "We stood in Dokdo to remember the past 99 years of the National Sports Festival and praise the strong will for national self-determination," adding that "100 years ago, our nation made a brilliant history of the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the government of the Republic of Korea, and we would like to add the 100-year history of the National Sports Festival to that history."</seg>

<seg id="2">It was also affected by the fact that 'consumers are moving away from tiled roofs' due to the sluggish housing market and repeated earthquake damage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Company Code: 530173983, Capital: 99.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative: Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daichi YOSHIDA (1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture; Daichi YOSHIDA Law Office; Tel: 06-6365-6038) and one other attorney represented the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our company is a roof tile manufacturer established in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, the company started its business under the trade name of Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. in Seidan-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minamiawaji City) as a manufacturer of ibushi-gawara tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island.</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, the company absorbed Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd.; at the same time, it changed its name to the current company name and moved its head office to the current location.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, sales bases were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established, and the main products used to be ibushi-gawara tiles, but due to changes in consumer needs, western-style tiles such as hiraita-gawara tiles now account for 70% and Japanese-style tiles such as ibushi-gawara tiles for 30%.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has built a wide-ranging business base centered in western Japan, including major house builders, building materials trading companies, and roofing contractors, and recorded annual sales of approximately 3,116 million yen in the fiscal year ended December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was reasonably well known as the top tile manufacturer in Awaji-shima Island.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, during this period, the housing market stagnated after the Lehman Shock, and consumers moved away from tiled roofs due to repeated damage from earthquakes such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, resulting in sluggish demand, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 fell to approximately 1,345 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the profit side, in addition to a decline in profit margins due to the sharp rise in fuel prices, the company was in a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt due to inventory burdens and capital investment, and was forced to manage its finances in a severe manner.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, the company tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there was no sign of recovery in business conditions and its financial position gradually became tight.</seg>
<seg id="14">When he came here, he gave up continuing the business because he could not support it, and it became a measure this time.</seg>
<seg id="15">The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), it was decided that discussions for full-scale operation of the fishery off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture would take shape on a district-by-district basis.</seg>
<seg id="3">A meeting of union presidents of the Prefectural Fishermen's Federation (Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations) was held at the Prefectural Fisheries Hall in Chuodai-Iino on the 27th, and with the heads of unions in the prefecture in attendance, Chairman Satoshi Nozaki said, "As the Prefectural Fishermen's Federation, I think that a trend toward full-scale operation is necessary, and I would like them to gather their representatives and start discussions."</seg>
<seg id="4">The union presidents' meeting also approved the official addition of Kasago, Sakuramasu, and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the shipping restriction order has been lifted, to the list of fish species subject to test operations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The remaining non-target marine products were two species of fish, Binosgai and Common Kasbe.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the meeting, Chairman Nozaki gave an interview to the press and emphasized that the start date of full-scale operation had not been decided yet.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that "tasteful arguments are a problem, and the position against the release of water into the ocean will not change" with regard to the treated water after purifying the contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and rebuffed the statements of Yoshiaki Harada, the former Minister of the Environment, and Ichiro Matsui, the mayor of Osaka City.</seg>
<seg id="8">When discussing the full-scale operation, Akira Egawa, the president of the Iwaki City Fishery Cooperative, pointed out that 'it is necessary to gather opinions from the bottom' and said that he would respect the intention of the members.</seg>

<seg id="7">Beautiful girls in the works of Kazuo Umezu (5 sheets)</seg>
<seg id="8">In the preface of "Bishojo Collection", there was a sentence that "Fear and ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out because of their beauty at the opposite extreme", but it may be that "fear" stands out more because there is a contrast such as a beautiful face distorted, turning into a grudge expression with a grudge ...</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a keyword "snake" that often appears in Kazuo Umezu's works, but snakes are perceived as "spooky creatures" by people who see them, and some people feel that they are "beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="10">There are people who like reptiles and people who don't like reptiles.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this way, "snake" may be a creature in which "beauty" and "ugly" are two sides of the same coin depending on the sensibility of the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, this creature has been revered as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" settled is said to be auspicious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Works based on the "snake" appeared in the "I'm Afraid of Mama!" series in 1965, such as "Hebi Shojo" (The Serpent Girl) and "Madara no Shojo" (The Mottled Girl).</seg>
<seg id="14">Generally speaking, a woman who becomes a "hebi-onna" is a beautiful woman with a shadow.</seg>
<seg id="15">To put it in an exciting way, you could call it a "cool beauty" type ... ...I feel like that's what the beautiful girls who appear in Umezu works have in common.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among them, "Orochi", the main character of "Orochi" serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of the Umezu work, but it goes into a deep sleep every hundred years to keep eternal life and eternal youth, and the part that has a mysterious power is somewhat reminiscent of a "snake".</seg>

<seg id="3">It has rapidly increased by 1.6 times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, an increase of 9 compared to last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Why is it a children's cafeteria now?</seg>
<seg id="5">Makoto Yuasa, the president of a non-profit organization and a social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.</seg>
<seg id="6">The area has become lonely due to the declining birthrate and aging population, and the shopping district has also declined.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was no place for people to meet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, 'there was a need for a regional hub for people-to-people interaction.'</seg>
<seg id="9">Even though it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "place for multi-generational exchange" where elderly people also participate.</seg>
<seg id="10">It leads not only to the elimination of eating alone, but also to child-rearing support and health promotion for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Break the cycle of poverty and revitalize the community.</seg>
<seg id="12">The important thing is not to create children who will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="13">It varies from once a month to a place that serves meals every day.</seg>
<seg id="14">They range in size from a few to several hundred people, with venues ranging from private homes to temples.</seg>
<seg id="15">An atmosphere is being created where people who want to do it can do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Such a low threshold is attractive.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, it is difficult to secure operating expenses and staff.</seg>
<seg id="18">We hear about issues such as safe management systems.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, Mr. Yuasa says, "Values change by interacting with many people" and "Connecting with society can be a safety net in the event of a disaster."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is like a ray of hope in a closed society.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The performance of the Iranian-made drone 'Ababir' used in this bombing has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing a downed U.S. military drone.</seg>
<seg id="3">It can be manufactured inexpensively and has a range of about 1000 km.</seg>
<seg id="4">Because it flies at a low altitude, it is difficult to be caught by radar, which is another advantage." (Toru Yokota, press photographer)</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 14, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, were bombed by ten military drones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Soon after, the Houthis, a rebel group in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">"There is no doubt that behind the Houthis is President Rouhani's Iran, which cannot allow its adversary Saudi Arabia to profit from its oil when it cannot export it, and wants to let the international community know that it will suffer if it continues its oil embargo against Iran," said Izuru Sugawara, an international political analyst.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the wake of the bombing, as much as half of Saudi Arabia's oil production was halted, and oil prices soared by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some say that if the situation continues as it is, the oil shock will come again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Now that Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East and wants to avoid military intervention by any means, at least until after next year's elections, Iran will continue to carry out drone strikes under the cover of the Houthis, but it is intolerable for the U.S. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future" (Mr. Sugawara)</seg>

<seg id="2">Ask the president who hired you (bizSPA!</seg>
<seg id="3">Delivered at 8:47 on 9/27 (Fri.)</seg>
<seg id="4">He is now a hugely popular YouTuber, especially among young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not uncommon for companies to hire a YouTuber and use it to advertise their products, but there is a company that has started an unusual system called "YouTuber recruitment" in which a YouTuber is hired by the company as a full-time employee.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).</seg>
<seg id="7">What does it mean to "adopt a YouTuber"?</seg>
<seg id="8">We spoke with Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX, who also serves as the representative of Staff First, the subsidiary where the YouTuber was actually hired.</seg>
<seg id="9">I want to support young people who are working hard to hire YouTubers</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first place, what kind of mechanism is "YouTuber recruitment"?</seg>
<seg id="11">Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Nowadays, the profession of YouTuber has become an aspiration of many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also ranked high in the ranking of occupations that elementary school students want to take in the future, and it is likely that more and more young people will aim for it in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the past, we have recruited and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as bandsmen and comedians.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" aims to recruit and support young people who are pursuing their dreams of becoming YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is an image that YouTubers are individuals who voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to "adopt" them?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: While many young people aspire to become YouTubers, the reality is that most YouTubers don't make as much money as they expected.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who produce and post videos while working part-time, and creators who are not recognized as YouTubers by their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide hired creators with a salary and an environment for content creation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We think that we will support activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, who will inevitably be in an unstable position at first.</seg>

<seg id="2">Napper, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Korea and Japan, said in an exclusive interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo on November 27 that he hopes South Korea will reconsider its decision to revoke the Japan-South Korea Comprehensive Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to refer to the abandonment and reconsideration of GSOMIA.</seg>
<seg id="4">GSOMIA is concluded by Japan and South Korea, Japan and the United States, and the United States and South Korea, respectively, and serves as a basis for sharing information on missile launches.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Korea announced in August that it would cancel the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and South Korea will collapse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Napper argued that "we cannot respond effectively to a crisis without GSOMIA."</seg>
<seg id="7">He strongly urged the reinstatement of South Korea, saying, 'There is time until the expiration.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Regarding the joint flight drill conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July, he recognized the threat as "the first time in history" and appealed that "it is essential for the U.S., South Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, to work together in the alliance."</seg>
<seg id="9">He pointed out that the recent deterioration in relations between Japan and South Korea "hurts the national interests of the United States."</seg>

<seg id="3">It has been 30 days and 20 years since the criticality accident that alarmed the myth of safety in the nuclear power industry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although about 90 percent of the cases were not assessed as level 0 (not important in terms of safety) on the International Assessment Scale (INES), which indicates the level of severity, a constant increase in safety awareness is required in light of the lessons learned from this accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jürgen Klopp, who won the Best Director award for The Best, reflected on his career in an interview and commented on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among the many statements that shocked the public was that of Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, his main rival for the Premier League title.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neymar's best friend Alves: "His happiness is still in Barça ..."</seg>
<seg id="5">After the award ceremony for The Best, the German claimed: "I couldn't have imagined anything better, I'm very happy, I'm proud to have won this award, it's been a great few days for me, I won it because of my players, the most important thing is the team."</seg>
<seg id="6">Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said he had "a lot of respect for him" and said: "What can I say about him?He's won a lot of trophies, the way his team plays is exceptional, he's the best manager I've played against and it's an honour to be nominated and compete for an award with him."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also mentioned managers Pochettino and Tottenham.</seg>
<seg id="8">"his last year was incredible, in many cases he wouldn't be remembered if he didn't win the title, he built the team little by little and played in great style."</seg>
<seg id="9">Klopp was undeterred about his best moment of 2019: " (CL) The comeback against Barcelona, many pundits and myself wouldn't have bet a centimetre on us, a 3-0 behind against a team with Messi and Suarez... it's like a death sentence, we had a small chance and we took it, I couldn't believe it, in retrospect you could say we won the European Cup, this game will be remembered by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked a more personal question at the end, Klopp concluded: "When I celebrated winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and I didn't even know where I was, this time it didn't happen, I don't like to get drunk because I'm a person who suffers from an obsession with self-control, I celebrated winning the European Cup very sparingly, I remember it all, if I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone from the bus."</seg>

<seg id="5">The special edition cars were developed based on the concept of 'CRAFTED.'</seg>
<seg id="6">CRAFTED embodies the desire to think about a person with the Japanese aesthetic sense cultivated in rich nature and history, and the sensitivity to perceive ambiguous things that are sought without words, and to create a new experience that shakes the mind by making full use of all methods from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology.</seg>
<seg id="7">LC's special specification car "PATINA Elegance" is based on the LC500/LC500h, and adopts Lexus' highest grade genuine leather L-ANILINE seat that balances durability while making use of softness and natural texture, and genuine leather steering using premium leather with soft touch.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was finished as a model that further enhanced the style and taste.</seg>
<seg id="9">L-ANILINE carefully selects only the raw skin of the highest grade, and realizes softness with a long-term softening process and a color coat aiming for a thin coating by our original technology.</seg>
<seg id="10">It improves the sitting comfort that wraps the body and the fit while running.</seg>
<seg id="11">Premium leather is also used for the steering wheel, so that the quality can be felt on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it is specially equipped with an Alcantara roof, a laser-etched scuff plate with a beautifully overlapping L-shaped motif, and a color head-up display.</seg>
<seg id="13">The interior adopts a combination color of bright patina brown exclusively for special edition cars and gorgeous brown arranged on the door trim, genuine leather seats and seat belts.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the stitching uses two colors of light brown and dark brown with different degrees of lightness, and combines it with a carefully selected texture to express a high-quality and deep space.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are three body colors: Terrain khaki mica metallic set exclusively for special edition cars, sonic titanium, and graphite black glass flakes.</seg>

<seg id="3">The "Yui Sakura Shrimp Project" of the Marine Industry Cluster Council, consisting of industry, academia, and government, including Shizuoka City, recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which are believed to have been born during the spawning season in the spring and summer of this year, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people concerned hope that it will lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of the Kanbara district of Shimizu Ward in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="6">A total of about 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previous findings that sakura shrimp, which live in the deep sea during the day, "form groups to some extent at the bottom of the sea" are once again supported.</seg>
<seg id="8">The adult was about 40 mm long, and the individual in the image was about 23 mm long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spawning season was identified by comparing it with the seasonal data of landed sakura shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="10">Detailed analysis is requested from Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka College of Industrial Technology, which make up the team.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want to capture the living state of individuals in the growth process, including juvenile shrimp," says Keisuke Mizuno, the project leader.</seg>

<seg id="2">&lt;Men's Singles&gt; (Bud x Spi!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japanese national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Basel, Switzerland), a big badminton event held in August, completed a training camp in early September and will participate in the China Open (Changzhou/Super 1000) starting from the 17th.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, we look back at the first half of the season from May to August, when the Olympic race to qualify for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and look ahead to the men's singles matches in the middle of the season (September to December) (Text / Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).</seg>
<seg id="5">The badminton Olympic race, which started in May, has digested the four top tournaments (Super 500 or higher) in which the top players compete at the end of the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two players who performed well in the first half of the season were Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Zhou Tiancheng of Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momota won the world championship and Zhou Tiancheng won the Indonesia OP (S1000), a tournament that can earn high points of "world ranking points", which is directly connected to the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="8">Momota also won the Japan Open (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">The team has participated in four tournaments since May: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia Open (July/results 16 strong), the Japan Open (July), and the World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.</seg>
<seg id="11">August was only one tournament of the world championship, so the fatigue will not be greater than the time of the consecutive games.</seg>
<seg id="12">A good result is required in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments after September.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is a Taiwanese ace who is strong in consecutive fights.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pay attention to young people in Thailand!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to being physically strong from the beginning, he is a player who does not suffer from consecutive games.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the tournament continues, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather, scoring high points in the first half would have made it easier to adjust the schedule for future tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zhou Tiancheng had an impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but this year he has become more stable on the playing surface, so he can continue to perform well.</seg>
<seg id="21">Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, is likely to be a more difficult opponent than ever.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to these two players, Thailand's young ace Kantaphon and India's Sai Praneeth B. achieved results in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="23">And it is three players of Anders Antonsen who are struggling alone as Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Cantaphone does not advance to the finals in the top competitions, it has gained the power to advance to the top, such as finishing in the best four in two competitions this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21 years old on the 18th), who can rally on an equal footing with the top players, seems to have a great possibility of making a leap in the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also, Sai Praneeth B. took a step forward in India, which has good players in singles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Bharama, Pranoy H.S. and Srikanth Kidambi, who is lagging behind due to injury, will also be catching up in the coming days, so India will need to be careful after the midfield battle.</seg>

<seg id="1">New mobile phone rates to be reduced through fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Edition</seg>
<seg id="2">With the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October, new rate plans for mobile phone companies are now available.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it generally remained at a high level.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that there was room to cut prices by about 40 percent, and despite growing expectations for a price cut, price competition did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is largely due to the postponement of Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market and the continued oligopoly of the three major companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">For consumers, it is desirable to have an easy-to-use fee system through fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revised law prohibits bundled discounts of terminal charges and communication charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">This was because the communication fee was set to be expensive instead of selling the terminal fee cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to offer handsets at up to half the price.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies have a "SIM lock" on their devices, which means they can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT DoCoMo will charge up to one-third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three companies seem to be continuing "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced a policy of mandating the immediate cancellation of SIM locks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to take immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to trigger a price-cutting competition, so he shrugged it off.</seg>
<seg id="18">There may have been a lack of foresight.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when the full-scale service will start or how much it will cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to engage in business responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="21">This rate revision was triggered by remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Suga complained about the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think that competition will start from now on. I do not think at all that it is fine as it is."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, I do not think that 'government-made price cuts' will distort the market and promote healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before being interfered by the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fee structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases in which consumers pay more than half the price even though the terminal advertises that 'the maximum price will be half the price.'</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies themselves must try to explain in a polite and easy-to-understand manner so as not to create misunderstandings among users.</seg>

<seg id="6">Although it is not enforced, there is expected to be a backlash from local chiefs and residents due to the fear that nearby hospitals will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at the meeting on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many of them had relatively few beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%) had the highest percentages.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hokkaido had the largest number of subjects with 54, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries established "recommended vaccination areas" for areas where there is a high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, based on the opinions of experts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number, and procedure of vaccination, receives confirmation from the ministry, and permits its use at the discretion of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures where vaccination is recommended are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">The regions will review the situation and decide again when the guidelines are revised.</seg>
<seg id="12">The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, excrement, etc. shall, in principle, be restricted within the area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meat and processed products are not targeted, considering the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and are in effect allowed to be distributed outside the region.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thoroughly dispose of food waste to prevent the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="15">It appeals for the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.</seg>
<seg id="16">The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Epidemic Control Headquarters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Keisuke Honda, an independent, makes a public approach to Man U!</seg>
<seg id="2">"Give me an offer, I don't need the money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="3">Broadcast on 9/28 (Sat) 2:57</seg>
<seg id="4">Former Japan national team midfielder Keisuke Honda, who left Australian A-League club Melbourne Victory at the end of last season and is no longer with the club, made a surprising move.</seg>
<seg id="5">[VIDEO] Was Keisuke Honda actually in the game?</seg>
<seg id="6">The astounding truth is revealed</seg>
<seg id="7">Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th, made a public approach to a club saying, "Please make me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."</seg>
<seg id="8">The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" was the world-famous Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make such a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?</seg>
<seg id="10">It was triggered by an article in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an article entitled "Five forwards up for grabs in Manchester United's injury crisis", he picked out five independents who are currently available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among the players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bony, there was Honda's name.</seg>
<seg id="13">United are currently in a state of emergency with a number of players injured, including midfielder Paul Pogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Antony Martial and forward Marcus Rashford.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Red Devils, coached by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, have had a difficult start to the season, with two wins and 22 defeats in the league, and have a problem with the quality of their front line.</seg>
<seg id="15">So it was Honda who was mentioned by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for leverage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the article, it is analyzed that "strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative player, not a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling."</seg>
<seg id="17">His nine goals in 18 appearances for Melbourne Victory is a "solid record", but it has also been pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to step away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team and get his full attention".</seg>
<seg id="18">Will Honda's approach bear fruit?</seg>
<seg id="19">It will also be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran, whose stated goal is to play in next year's Tokyo Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on January 26 that a total of 500 machines have been installed at shops in Hamamatsu City as part of a project to lend the portable translator "PokeTalk" to member offices free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is said that this translator will be deployed intensively in the same area for the first time in Japan, and attention should be paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists (travelers visiting Japan).</seg>

<seg id="6">The middle section of the city accounts for 60% of the population.</seg>

<seg id="8">It can be accessed from the website of the Lake Hamana sightseeing area.</seg>
<seg id="9">The free loan of PokéTalk, which supports 74 languages, started in April in response to the declaration of "Japan's No. 1 inbound support city, Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.</seg>
<seg id="10">The chamber will purchase 500 units and lend them for two years to small- and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as Omotenashi (hospitality) certification and the introduction of cashless payments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Now the direct dora master, Hiroyo Ikemura, doesn't even need a tie-up for the first shot?</seg>
<seg id="2">Today's Caddy's Best Shot</seg>
<seg id="3">A 1W shot is not necessarily a tee-up shot.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a technique called "choku-dora," in which a player hits a ball on the ground when he wants to gain distance by hitting a par-5 second shot.</seg>
<seg id="5">The recent 1W involves the risk of the ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who frequently practice this on the tee ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is Hiroyo Ikemura who is waiting for his first victory on the tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a pro, is small at 166 cm tall, but currently ranks seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).</seg>
<seg id="8">While he was good at long shots, one of his challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.</seg>
<seg id="9">In early spring, he opened his eyes and said, "The spoon (3W) shot wasn't good, so I thought about doing a straight drama."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, he sometimes drops the ball on the turf of Tearia and casually shakes off 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where big carry is required, tee-ups are often used, but direct drag is effectively used in halls that are narrow on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It can be used in a hall where the eyes are lowered."</seg>
<seg id="13">In the ballistic measuring instrument, it recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in the carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"That's why I don't need a 3W, and my caddie feels more secure with a direct-dora than a 3W..."</seg>
<seg id="15">From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, there is only 1 watt of wood in the caddie bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is UT with a loft of 17 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The tactics surprised even my tour friends, and I was happy to hear the voice of admiration from the gallery I saw.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to shake the club to a level (horizontal).</seg>
<seg id="19">"Even if it is a down blow, even if you hit it with an upper, it does not fly straight. If it is a cut trajectory, it goes to the right. Originally I was doing a direct drag to correct the swing of the (tie-up) shot of 1 W. This practice also moderates the attack angle (incidence angle of the club). "</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and there is a risk of slicing, but "so the left side can be erased (it does not turn left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">It is easy to say ... but it is a professional technique that groans involuntarily.</seg>

<seg id="7">Even after I made a bogey at No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so I was trying to get it back, but a chip-in eagle came at No. 6.</seg>
<seg id="8">I got a birdie at No. 7 and it gave me a chance, but after all I was frustrated that I could not improve in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="9">What did you gain from this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="10">I haven't been playing well lately, so it was good that I was able to hold on well even on a course with narrow fairways.</seg>
<seg id="11">The rough was also a course where the order and the reverse were different, and the way to hit and the distance changed, so I didn't have much (experience), so I learned a lot.</seg>
<seg id="12">How is it different from a regular tournament?</seg>
<seg id="13">A place where it was possible to shoot with a camera (such as a smartphone).</seg>
<seg id="14">I didn't mind at all, but the gallery took a lot of videos.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was not much that changed other than that, but it was just a co-sponsored tournament with few Japanese players, so I approached the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players".</seg>
<seg id="16">The second half will continue from now on, but if I do not win more than one, I will not be able to aim for the prize money king, so I would like to win one more victory, and there is also a ZOZO Championship nearby, so I will do my best to get in the top of the tournament and qualify.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is the way to prevent dementia and keep it at the level of "forgetfulness"?</seg>
<seg id="2">Interview and text by Yo WATANABE</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a drug for dementia that has been frustrated by the challenge of research and development by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be limited to extremely mild symptoms and forgetfulness.</seg>
<seg id="5">We spoke with Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center at Kinki University Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia won't go away.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dementia prevention or treatment is long-awaited, but what is the current situation?</seg>
<seg id="8">Otsuki: Everyone has the potential to develop dementia as they age, with varying degrees of severity, from mild to severe.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drug donepezil, which is often used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance in some overseas countries, so it is not expected to have a significant curative effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, while deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to remarkable advances in treatments such as anticancer drugs, people are now able to live longer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not something that can be solved by individuals or their families alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep it to the level of 'forgetting things'</seg>
<seg id="15">There are people who are more or less likely to develop dementia. ― Are there people who are more or less likely to develop dementia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Otsuki: Even if dementia is inevitable, there is a possibility that it can be limited to "forgetfulness" by suppressing symptoms as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered to be a lifestyle-related disease, and there is a tendency in people who are prone to it.</seg>
<seg id="18">First of all, people with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power also has an impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the United States, there are regions that distribute food tickets called food tickets to the poor, but the foods that can be received with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">People who can't use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they can't cook in the first place can use it.</seg>
<seg id="24">This leads to a diet low in vegetables and protein, and a lifestyle biased toward fats and carbohydrates.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, although they are poor, they become obese, and all they have to do is watch TV and become disabled.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can be found in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work are also more likely to develop dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis without becoming a metabolic syndrome.</seg>
