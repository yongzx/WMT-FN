<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">A number of accidents involving young people who pedal incorrectly (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! news</seg>
<seg id="3">Violation of the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">There has been an increase in the number of reports of accidents caused by incorrect operation, such as pedal mistakes, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to data from the National Police Agency in 2015, the most common type of pedal mistake occurred in 1080 cases involving people under the age of 24, exceeding the 1,032 cases involving people over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mistakes by mistake are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you want to take a fancy look at your feet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you want to take safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike the elderly, who are often thought to be caused by physical deterioration such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may inadvertently make mistakes due to being distracted by other things such as music or conversation, or mistake mistakes due to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Especially women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mules, and various shoes depending on the outfit of the day, and some people drive as it is.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some people say that it is troublesome to change shoes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all and drive without offense.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels or sandals is against the Road Traffic Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is to "reliably operate the steering wheel, brake and other operations" and Article 70 "Violation of safe driving obligation" which stipulates that "you must not drive in such a way as to cause an accident and cause harm to a person."</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, in the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, Article 12 states: "do not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) wearing shoes, slippers, shoes, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with the operation of the vehicle, or wear footwear in a manner that interferes with the operation of the vehicle."</seg>
<seg id="15">Each prefecture has the same intention to consider driving with "footwear that may interfere with driving operation" as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.</seg>
<seg id="16">So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?</seg>
<seg id="17">That's obvious when you consider the basics of safe pedal operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe pedal operation, the heel of the foot is fixed to the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the tip of the foot is tilted to the right as a fulcrum.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to firmly fix the heel so that it does not shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small, and it is always wobbly, and because the whole foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the foot that touches the pedal is also small, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is thought to lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but the heels of high heels are easy to catch on this material, and when the heel is caught in a sudden brake, the pedal can not be stepped on, or the high heels can be taken off at the time when the heel is caught, and it may be stuck in the back of the pedal and can not be stepped on.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, there are cases where the heel gets caught on the back side of the pedal when returning after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal does not return.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was also affected by the sluggishness of the housing market and the fact that "consumers moved away from tiled roofs" due to repeated damage from the earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Company Code: 530173983; Capital: 99.2 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; President: Kozo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-bankruptcy in the Kobe District Court on August 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka; Daichi Yoshida Law Office, Tel: 06-6365-6038) and one other attorney represented the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company was founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961 (Showa 36).</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, he started a business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tile, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minami Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, the company absorbed Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. at the same time, it changed its name and moved its head office to its current location.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, sales offices were opened in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company has built a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building material trading companies, and roofing contractors, and recorded annual sales of approximately 3,116 million yen in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">He had a considerable reputation as one of the top tile makers in Awaji Island.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, due to the sluggishness in the housing market since the Lehman shock and the repeated damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand has been sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 fell to approximately 1,345 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the profit side, in addition to a decline in profit margins due to the surge in fuel prices, the company was saddled with an excessive amount of interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and capital investment, resulting in a continuous deficit, and was forced to make tough financial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, although it was trying to rebuild its business by asking financial institutions to ease the terms of repayment of loans, there were no signs of a recovery in business conditions, and its financial position gradually became tight.</seg>
<seg id="14">I came here and gave up the business continuity because I could not support it, and this was the measure of this time.</seg>
<seg id="15">The debt is currently under investigation and is expected to be about 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="12">In addition, this creature has been worshiped as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" settled is said to be auspicious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Umezu works based on the theme of "snake" include "Serpent girl" and "mottled girl" from the "Mama is scary!" series in 1965.</seg>
<seg id="14">In general, it is the market that a beautiful woman with a shadow becomes a "snake woman."</seg>

<seg id="4">He is now a hugely popular YouTuber, mainly among young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not uncommon now for companies to use them to advertise their products, but there is a company that has started an unusual system called "YouTuber recruitment" to hire them as full-time employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX) is a company whose main business is customer relationship management (CRM).</seg>
<seg id="7">What does it mean to "adopt a YouTuber"?</seg>
<seg id="8">We asked Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of Stuff First, the subsidiary where the YouTuber was actually adopted.</seg>
<seg id="9">I want to support young people who are doing their best by hiring YouTubers</seg>
<seg id="10">- What is the mechanism of "YouTuber recruitment" in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="11">Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): nowadays, the profession of YouTuber has become an aspiration of many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Elementary school students are also at the top of the list of occupations they want to enter in the future, and there will be more and more young people aiming to do so in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until now, we have been recruiting and supporting young people who are chasing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" is trying to recruit and support young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="15">- There is an image that YouTubers are individuals who voluntarily post videos, but why did you think about "hiring"?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: while many young people aspire to the profession of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers do not make as much money as they would like.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and there are also many creators whose families do not recognize the existence of YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide the hired creators with a salary and an environment for content creation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We think that we will support activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber who will inevitably be in a precarious position at first.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, an initiative of the Council of Marine Industry Clusters of Shizuoka City and other cities, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which are believed to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, on the seabed at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video of the growth process is valuable, and those involved want to connect it to the elucidation of the ecology of the sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The photo was taken about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu Ward, Shimizu City, near the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="6">A total of about 300 animals were confirmed in 17 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conventional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea during the day "form a group to some extent at the bottom of the sea" has been confirmed anew.</seg>
<seg id="8">The adult is about 40 millimeters in length, and the reflected individual is about 23 millimeters in length.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spawning season was identified by comparing the seasonal data of the landed sakura shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="10">Detailed analysis is entrusted to Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka College of Industrial Technology, which comprise the team.</seg>
<seg id="11">Keisuke Mizuno, the project leader, says, "We want to capture the living form of the individual in the growth process, including juvenile shrimp."</seg>

<seg id="2"> inferior Men's Singles inferior Bud × Spi!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japan national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, a major badminton event held in August, will participate in the China OP (Changzhou / Super 1000) starting from the 17th after a training camp in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, we look back at the first half of the year from May to August, when the Olympic race for the Tokyo 2020 Games begins, and look ahead to the men's singles matches from September to December (Text / Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).</seg>
<seg id="5">The badminton Olympic race, which began in May, has digested the top four tournaments (Super 500 and above) in which the top players compete at the end of the world championships.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two players who kept up their good form in the first half were Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Tian Cheng Chow of Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momota won the World Championship, and Zhou Tiancheng won the Indonesia Open (S1000), a tournament where high points can be earned for "world ranking points," which is directly linked to the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="8">Momota has also won the Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">Since May, he has participated in the Sudirman Cup (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / results 16 strong), Japan OP (July), and World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since August was only one tournament of the World Championship, the fatigue will not be greater than the time of the back-to-back matches.</seg>
<seg id="12">Good results are required in the midfield, where the top competitions will be held consecutively from September onwards.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ace of Taiwan is strong in a series of battles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also pay attention to young people in Thailand!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the top competition of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven events.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September, and won brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to being physically strong, he is a player who does not suffer from a series of matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the tournament continues, there will be no major problems with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the contrary, being able to score high points in the first half would have made it easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="20">Until last year, Zhou had the impression that he lacked explosive power, but this year he has become more stable on the playing surface, which has allowed him to continue to perform well.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, it looks like he will be a more troublesome opponent than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to these two players, young Thai ace Kantaphone and India's Sai Praneeth B. had good results in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="23">And Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European player, is three players.</seg>
<seg id="24">Despite not reaching the finals in any of the top competitions, Cantafon has been a force to be reckoned with, finishing in the top four in the two competitions this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21 years old on the 18th), who has been able to rally on an equal footing with the top players, seems to have a lot of potential to make a leap in the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sai Praneeth B. also took a step out of India, which has a good lineup of players in singles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Barama, Prannoy H.S. and Srikanth Kidambi, who is lagging behind due to injury, will also be looking to catch up in the future, so India will need to be careful after the midfield battle.</seg>

<seg id="2">In response to the enactment of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October, mobile phone companies have come up with new pricing plans.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the most part, however, it remained high.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that there was room to lower prices by about 40 percent, and despite growing expectations for a rate cut, there was no price competition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rakuten's full-fledged entry into the market has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the big three companies continues to be a major factor.</seg>
<seg id="6">For consumers, it is desirable to have a fee structure that is easy to use through fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amended law bans set discounts on terminal fees and communication charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is because, instead of selling the terminal fee at a low price, the communication fee was set to become expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to cut handsets by up to half.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies have a "SIM lock" on their terminals that prevents them from using other companies' lines for 100 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT Docomo will pay a maximum of one-third of the terminal fee only to subscribers of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three companies appear to be continuing to "corral" customers to prevent them from switching to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With regard to the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has indicated that it is obligated to release it immediately.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to take immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the development of communication networks, such as base stations, did not proceed as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a trigger for the price cut competition, so it is dressed with a shrug.</seg>
<seg id="18">I wonder if there was a sweetness in the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when the full-scale service will start or how much it will cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to engage in business responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="21">The latest rate revision was triggered by remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Kan expressed dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think at all that it is fine as it is."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is unlikely that "government-made price cuts" will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before being dictated to by the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fee structure of each company is very complicated, and it is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half price, even though the terminal advertises such as "up to half price."</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies themselves should try to explain in a polite and easy-to-understand manner, so as not to create misunderstandings among users.</seg>

<seg id="9">The hot fighting spirit has crossed the line.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was 0 to 38 in the 29th minute.</seg>
<seg id="11">Deep in enemy territory, England captain Farrell lost his balance somewhat when catching a pass from his side.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Quill who went to tackle it.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, he woke up not from the waist down, but from the upper body, and hit his body violently on the upper body.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the head of the opponent comes into contact with the head, and it is shaped like a head butt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Farrell was blown away violently and fell to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">England players protested furiously as they tried to shove Quill into a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Players from both sides gathered at once, and there was an air of simmering excitement.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result of the TMO (video review), Quill was sent off with a straight red card.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with a bad look on his face, but was booed by some in the crowd who were calling for fair play.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="3">⇒ 4 hospitals subject to reorganization: "standards are wrong"</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to curb the ballooning cost of medical care due to the aging population, we decided to take an unusual step, saying that it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan calls for a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospitals in October, and for a conclusion to be reached by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not enforceable, but there is expected to be a backlash from local chiefs and residents over fears that hospitals close to them will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at a meeting on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and there were many hospitals with relatively few beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">By prefecture, the proportion was highest in Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).</seg>
<seg id="10">The largest number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and the only one was zero in Okinawa.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on data from fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare surveyed 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to the "high acute phase" for severe patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">They analyzed the results of nine items, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals were located "within a 20-minute drive," to determine the necessity of publishing the names of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Target hospitals will be asked to consider abolishing the practice and moving some departments to other hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Health care costs will skyrocket in the next 25 years, when all baby boomers will be over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds nationwide to 1,191 thousand in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, there are a large number of beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute phase," which are heavily staffed with nurses and incur medical expenses, but there is a shortage of beds for rehabilitation with high needs for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "regional medical concept" that specifies the number of beds needed for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">It divides the country into 339 districts and consults with local governments and health officials, but many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious stance, making the discussions difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) hopes to revitalize the debate by publicizing the names of hospitals with poor records.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on April 27 that it will revise its epidemic prevention guidelines to allow preventive vaccination of farmed pigs, which is not currently allowed, in order to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government plans to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi, where outbreaks of the disease have been confirmed in pigs and wild boar.</seg>
<seg id="4">The movement of vaccinated live pigs, fertilized eggs, etc. is restricted within the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is permitted outside the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">It aims to complete the procedure by the end of October at the earliest, after making public comments to the public.</seg>
<seg id="6">By using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat and other products outside the region, the country would no longer be a "clean country" that had been recognized by international organizations, which could have an impact on pork exports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the outbreak in September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has been temporarily on hold.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under the proposed amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up "vaccination recommended areas" in areas where there is a high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, based on the opinions of experts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope and timing of vaccination, the number of vaccinators, and how to proceed. the program will be confirmed by the ministry and approved for use at the governor's discretion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures that have been proposed as recommended vaccination areas are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the Guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide anew.</seg>
<seg id="12">In principle, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, excrement, etc. is restricted within the region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meat and processed products will not be targeted based on the cost of restricting distribution and the impact on farmers, and will in effect be allowed to be distributed outside the region.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thoroughly dispose of food waste in order not to spread the virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also advocate for the safety of inoculated pigs and work to prevent reputational damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The revised guidelines were compiled by a panel of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Infectious Disease Control Headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the future, opinions will be referred to the prefectural government and public comments will be made until October 7 to implement the new epidemic prevention guidelines.</seg>

<seg id="2">"give me an offer, I don't need the money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo! news</seg>
<seg id="3">9 / 28 (Sat) 2: 57 delivery</seg>
<seg id="4">After leaving Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, former Japanese midfielder Keisuke Honda, who is currently an independent player, made a surprising move.</seg>
<seg id="5">[video] Keisuke Honda, were you actually in the game?</seg>
<seg id="6">The staggering truth will be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th, made a public approach to a club, saying, "Please make me an offer, I don't need the money, but I need to play with a great team and a great teammate."</seg>
<seg id="8">The "reverse offer" was sent to Manchester United, one of the most prestigious clubs in the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make such a grand request to one of the Premier League's most powerful clubs?</seg>
<seg id="10">It all started with an article on the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was published on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an article entitled "The five forwards Manchester United may have in the midst of an injury crisis," five independent players who are currently available were picked up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among the players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonny, Honda's name was also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="13">United are currently in a state of emergency following a spate of injuries to midfielder Paul Pogba and defenders Luke Shaw, Eric Bailly, Anthony Martial and Marcus .</seg>
<seg id="14">The Red Devils, led by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, have had a difficult start to the season, with 22 wins from two in the league, and have issues with the quality of their front line.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, it was Honda who was named by the Australian media as a candidate for the new force.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is said to be the first time in Japan that the translator will be deployed centrally in the same region, and attention will be paid to whether it will lead to an improvement in the ability to respond to inbound (inbound travelers).</seg>
<seg id="5">The loans were made to 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.</seg>
<seg id="6">The district covers 60% of the city.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company has also started displaying lending destinations on its map app, Google Maps, so that users can see the locations of "foreign-language stores" on their smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="8">It can be accessed from the Lake Hamana Tourist Area website.</seg>
<seg id="9">The free loan of PokeTalk, which supports 74 languages, was launched in April in response to the declaration of Hamamatsu as Japan's number one inbound support city by nine organizations in the city.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small- and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as receiving hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kanze Ikemura, who is now a master of direct Dora, doesn't need a tie-up for the first shot?</seg>
<seg id="2">My caddie's best shot today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A 1W shot is not necessarily something to tee up and hit.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a technique called "Direct Dora" where you hit the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance, such as the second shot of the par-5.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the recent 1W, there is a risk that the ball will scatter due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently even on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kanze Ikemura is waiting for his first victory on the Tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a professional, is small at 166 cm tall and currently ranks seventh in the Driving Distance category (average 304.02 yd).</seg>
<seg id="8">While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.</seg>
<seg id="9">In early spring, he opened his eyes and said, "I didn't like the spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I'd do a straight Dora."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the turf of the tea area and shake off 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where a big carry is required, tie-up is often used, but both sides make effective use of direct Dora in narrow holes and so on.</seg>
<seg id="12">"you can use it in a hall where the line of sight is lowered."</seg>
<seg id="13">The ballistics instrument recorded between 270 and 280 yd in the carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"that's why I don't need 3W, my caddie can feel more secure than 3W..."</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Woods has only 1W in his caddie bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.</seg>
<seg id="17">The tactics surprised even my tour companions, and I was happy to hear the voices of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick, he said, is to "shake the club to a level (horizontal)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if you hit it with a down blow or an upper, it will not fly straight, if it is a cut trajectory, it will go to the right.Originally I was doing a straight drag to straighten the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tie-up).</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and there is a risk of a slice, "so the left side can be erased (it does not turn to the left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it is easy to say... it is a professional skill that groans involuntarily.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "memory loss"?</seg>
<seg id="2">Interview and text by Yo Watanabe</seg>
<seg id="3">Dementia drugs have suffered setbacks as major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have taken on the challenge of research and development.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it seems that it is becoming clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to a very slight degree of memory.</seg>
<seg id="5">We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of Kindai University Hospital Stroke Center.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia is not going away.</seg>
<seg id="7">- Dementia prevention or treatment drugs are eagerly awaited, but what is the current situation?</seg>
<seg id="8">Otsuki: from mild to severe, there is a possibility that everyone will get dementia when they get older, regardless of the degree of difference.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">A drug called donepezil, which is often used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance in some countries overseas, and it is not expected to have a significant complete cure effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to the remarkable progress in the treatment of anticancer drugs, etc., and people have been able to live longer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not something that can be solved by individuals or their families alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep it to the extent that it's "forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="15">- Are there people who are prone to dementia and those who are difficult to become?</seg>
<seg id="16">Otsuki Even if dementia is inevitable, there is a possibility that symptoms can be suppressed as much as possible and kept to the extent of "forgetting."</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and there is a tendency for people who are prone to it.</seg>
<seg id="18">First of all, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be more prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power also has an impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but the foods that can be received with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizza, and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">It can be used by people who can't use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they can't cook in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you do, you will end up eating a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, and you will end up living a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, they become poor but obese, and the only thing they have to do is watch TV and become physically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can be found in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work are also prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis.</seg>
