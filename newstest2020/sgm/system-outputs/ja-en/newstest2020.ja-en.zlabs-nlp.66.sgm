<seg id="1">It's dangerous to drive in high heels!</seg>
<seg id="2">"Auto Messe Web - Yahoo! News".</seg>
<seg id="3">Violation of the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a big mistake to think that it's only a problem for elderly drivers, although the number of reported accidents caused by mismanagement, such as pedals, has increased.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the 2015 Census, there were 1,080 cases of pedal foot failure in the United States under the age of 24, outnumbering 1,032 cases of pedal foot failure over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is important to call attention to young people in the same way, not to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you want me to take a look at your feet?</seg>
<seg id="8">You want to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike older people who are often considered to be due to the decline of their body, such as driving skills, reflex nerves, and so on, young people may be worried about other things such as music, conversation, and misstep due to the fact that they are wearing clothes.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, women choose high heels, pampus, sandals, and mules, as well as a variety of shoes that day and drive them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is difficult to change clothes, but many people don't think it's a danger at all, and drive without care.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">One is to "restrict the operation of the wheel, brakes, and other operations" and the other is a violation of the "security obligation to drive" (Article 70), which states that "the driver must not drive to cause an accident and cause harm to the person."</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, in Article 12 of the provisions of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, the driver must comply with the regulations of the Prefectural Public Safety Commission, and there is a sentence: "Do not wear a vehicle (except a light vehicle) by wearing a footwear that may prevent the operation of the vehicle from being operated by slippers, hookers, high heels, or so on."</seg>
<seg id="15">The purpose of each prefecture is to regard the operation of the operation as a violation of 'ordinary footwear that might interfere with the operation of the operation' even though it is not specified as a high heel.</seg>
<seg id="16">Why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?</seg>
<seg id="17">It is clear to think of the basic principles of safe pedal operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safety pedal operations, the feet are fixed to the floor, and the feet are placed to vertical against the brake pedal, and when stepping on the axel pedal, the feet are tilted to the right.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this case, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it doesn't break.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels, the surface area of the capsule is small and always blends with the grapes, and because of the height of the heels, the angle of the foot is attached to the whole of the foot, the area of the foot to which the pedals are grounded is also small, making it difficult to adjust to the floor.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most cars also have a floor carpet, but this material can easily be caught with a high heel, and when the heel is caught by a fast brake, the pedal cannot be stepped, or the heel must be stepped off to the heel, and the pedal can be stuck in the back of the pedal.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are also cases where the heel fell behind the pedal and the axel pedal stopped returning.</seg>

<seg id="2">It also affected the progress of 'consumer's separation of tile roofs' due to the decline in housing and frequent earthquakes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kinki ceramics (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, Odani 881-8 in Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative: Kozo FUKUHARA, 44 employees) filed for semi-self bankruptcy at Kobe District Court on August 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">The applicant agent was Yoshida Ochi Lawyer (Nishi Tenma 1-10-8, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, Yoshida Ochi Law Office, telephone number 06-6365-6038).</seg>
<seg id="5">The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized into a tile manufacturer in April 1961.</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, the company started its business as a local industry of Awaji-shima Island in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki kiln industry (kabu).</seg>
<seg id="7">In October, 866, the company absorbed Kyowa kiln industry (kabu) and succeeded the business of Kinki industry (kabu), and the company changed its name to its current name and moved its head office to its current location.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, the company established business bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, and so on, and used to mainly use ibushi-gawara, but now, due to changes in consumer needs, western tiles such as flat tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70% and 30% of Japanese tiles such as ibushi-gawara.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company has built a wide range of business bases in western Japan, including major house makers, construction materials companies, roof companies, and so on, and by December 2004, the company had an annual sales of approximately 316 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji-shima Island.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, as a result of the economic downturn in the housing market after the Riemann Shock, and the frequent earthquakes and earthquakes in the eastern Japan and Kumamoto, the demand for tile roofs increased, and the annual sales in December 2018 fell to approximately 1345 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the company's profits were reduced due to the rise in fuel prices, and the company suffered a series of deficits due to excessive stock burdens and investment in facilities.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, the company sought to revive its management by requesting the financial institutions to relax the terms of repayment of the loan, but it did not show any signs of recovery, and it was increasingly difficult to finance the business.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was unable to keep up with the project and decided to abandon the project.</seg>
<seg id="15">The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="4">Since the 1950s, a collection of beautiful and beautiful girls (Genko-sha) has been released, focusing on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, known as the leading figure in the "Fear Manga", which has been published since August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">When he sees it in his hand, he realizes that it is a correlation between 'beautiful' and 'fear' in his works.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is it attractive because there's a shadow?</seg>
<seg id="7">Baizu Kazuo's beautiful girls (five pieces)</seg>
<seg id="8">In the introduction to The Beautiful Girl Collection, there is also a sentence that "the shocking scenes and developments of the story are distinguished only by the beauty of the beautiful women in the opposite direction", but the contrast between the beautiful faces and the resentment of a grudge ... may be more prominent.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a key word 'snake' that appears in many of Baizu-zukazu's works, but the snakes are regarded by the viewer as 'a creepy creature' and some people feel 'beautiful.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people like reptiles, while others do not like them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beautiful" and "ugly" may be the same creature as the snake.</seg>
<seg id="12">This creature has been revered as a more spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "White Snake" lived is good luck.</seg>
<seg id="13">The film's title is a reference to the 1965 film The Girl Who's Who and the Girl Who's Who.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's about a beautiful woman with a shadows to become 'Hebi Onna' (literally, "beautiful woman").</seg>
<seg id="15">I think it's a good idea to say that it's a "cool buttie" type, and I think it's like it's a common feature of beautiful girls appearing in the works of Baizu.</seg>
<seg id="16">In particular, 'Orochi,' the main character of "Orochi" serialized in 'Shokun Shonen Sunday' from 1969, is a beautiful girl character who can be said to be a representative of Baizu's works, but it is reminiscent of 'Snake' by having a deep sleep every 100 years to preserve eternal life and eternal youth.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Bad X-Spy" (in Japanese).</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japan national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel in Badminton in August, finished in early September and entered the Chinese OP (Jiangzhou/Super1000) in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a list of events that took place between May and August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held in Tokyo, and the men's singles were held in mid-September and December.</seg>
<seg id="5">The badminton Olympics, which began in May, erased four of the top five Super 500 events at the end of the World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first half of the tournament, two of the four winners, Kento Momoda, and Chiang Tiancheng (Chow Tiancheng) of Taiwan, won the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momoeda won the World Championship, and Zhou Tensei won the OP (S1000) and the "World Ranking Points" which were directly linked to the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, MomoDA also won the Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">The tournament has been contested since May by four teams: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/July), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the fact that there are fewer players in the team, it is a very difficult task to keep up with the game.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only one World Championships were held in August, but it would not be much more fatigue than wartime.</seg>
<seg id="12">The following week, the team's best results were announced in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Taiwan Ace".</seg>
<seg id="14">Attention to young men in Thailand!</seg>
<seg id="15">He also won the Indonesian OP and Thai OP (S500) Championships, and had already won seven.</seg>
<seg id="16">In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a very competitive player, and does not want to play any games.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even after the convention, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather, it would have been easier to adjust the schedule of the next contest by getting high points in the first half of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="20">The game was a success, but by the end of the year, it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the game.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Momoeda, the world's top ranking player, he seems to be a more difficult opponent than ever.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the first half of the season, he played for the Thai youth ace Cantaphone and the Indian team Sai Planetis B..</seg>
<seg id="23">"Anders Antonsen's All-America Team".</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the Cantafone did not advance to the final, they were able to advance to the top four in the second round of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although there is still a rough side, it is likely that Larry, who became equal to the top player at the age of twenty-one on the 18th, had a great chance of jumping in the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sai Planetes B. also took a step out of India, where he was a good player in singles.</seg>

<seg id="1">A new charge for a cell phone, a fair competition, a low price for an electronic version of the Hokkaido Shimbun.</seg>
<seg id="2">In October, a new charge plan for a mobile phone company was put into effect with the enactment of the Telecommunication Business Act.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it was largely overcrowded.</seg>
<seg id="4">The President of the Republic of China said that "there was a chance to lower the price by 40%" in the last summer, but the price competition did not occur, despite increasing expectations of lowering the price.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main reason for this is that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed and the oligarchy of the three major companies continued.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is desirable for consumers to become a fees system that is easy to use due to fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">I want the efforts of the mobile companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The law prohibits discounts on terminals and communications fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead of selling the device at a low price, the cost of communication was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Softbank and KDDI(au) announced plans to increase the terminal to a maximum of half the cost.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, both companies have a "SIM lock" system that can be used on terminals for 100 days without using another company's connection.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT DoCoMo will pay a maximum of one-third of the terminal fee to only contractors of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">The three companies seem to continue to keep 'encirclement' to prevent transfer to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The U.S. Department of Defense issued a decree requiring immediate removal of SIM rock.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, it was decided that the network would not be able to continue as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be an explosive in a price-decrease competition, but it was dressed in a shaved shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm afraid he had a good sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear when or when the actual service started.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to work on the business with responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">This change was made in response to the resignation of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Sugawara expressed dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start. I don't think it's okay at all."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it does not seem that 'the government-made price reduction' distorts the market and encourages healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are made available to the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The price system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Agency called attention because there were cases where the consumer's burdens exceeded half of the price, even though the terminals were advertised as "the largest half of the price."</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to avoid misunderstanding of the user, the company must be careful and understandable.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health and Welfare verified the performance of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities in Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama-cho, Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho, Tokyo, Japan, were used.</seg>
<seg id="3">4 hospitals which are subject to reorganization: 'The standard is wrong'</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to reduce the expenditure of health care expenditures due to aging, he took an unusual step toward dealing with the need for reorganization and consolidation of hospitals in competing regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">In October, he requested that the hospital be reorganized and consolidated into a full-fledged hospital, and the plan was to make the conclusion by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although there is no compulsion, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will rebel due to fear that there will be no nearby hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was published at the same meeting.</seg>
<seg id="8">The total number of hospitals was 29%, and the number of hospitals was relatively low.</seg>

<seg id="12">He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency care, and the need to publish the hospital's name by analyzing whether a competitor's hospital was located within 20 minutes of the car.</seg>
<seg id="13">The hospital will be closed and some of the clinics will be moved to other hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="16">Currently, there are many beds for "high-acute" and "acute" periods, where nurses are well-paid and medical expenses are high, but there is no need for high-needs rehabilitation for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">To cope with aging, not only reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to improve the quality of the hospital, the Ministry of Health and Health decided to create a "regional health plan" for each prefecture, which required 25 years of beds.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries announced an amendment to the epidemiological guidelines that would allow preventative vaccination of pigs that are not currently recognized.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a policy to select nine prefectures, such as Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to infect pigs and wild boars.</seg>
<seg id="4">Migration of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the range, but it is permitted to be distributed outside the range of meat and processed products.</seg>
<seg id="5">After a public comment (public opinion poll) and so on, the procedure is expected to be completed by October.</seg>
<seg id="6">By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer recognized as a "clean country" by the International Organization and may affect the export of pork.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the outbreak of September of last year, Japan has been in a position of a clean country for a while.</seg>
<seg id="8">In response, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a "vaccination-recommended area" for areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Ministry of Health and Human Services is responsible for the creation of a "vaccine vaccination program" that combines the range of vaccination, the time of vaccination, the number of heads, and how to proceed, and allows the use of the vaccine by the governor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures that are recommended for inoculation are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the decision is made, the decision is made to change the situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ingested pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpse, and debris are generally restricted to the area.</seg>
<seg id="13">For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution or the influence of farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribute them outside the area.</seg>
<seg id="14">To avoid spreading the virus, the process of food trash is thoroughly handled.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also advocates for the safety of inoculated pigs and to prevent pollution.</seg>
<seg id="16">The reform of the guidelines was met at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the headquarters of the epidemiological countermeasures.</seg>

<seg id="9">Why do you want to make a big deal of money for the club?</seg>

<seg id="15">As a result, the New York Times called him a potential candidate for the position.</seg>
<seg id="16">The article analyzes that "Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole where Andreas Pereira is buried."</seg>
<seg id="17">His nine goals in 18 games for the Melbourne Victory were "a solid record", but it has been pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda has to leave his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team and get full attention".</seg>

<seg id="4">There is also a technique called "Jikudora" (literally, "direct drum") in which a ball is played on the ground when a player wants to earn a distance from the second ball in the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent years, 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of dispersing the ball, although some players often practice it on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is Kansei IKEMURA's first victory on the tour.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the age of 24 in his professional year, he was 166 cm tall, but is currently seventh in the Driver Distance Division with an average of 304.02 yd.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he was good at longshot, one of his tasks was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the spring, he said, "I couldn't get a shot at Spoon 3W, so I thought I'd try to get a shot at Naodora."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, the ball is dropped on Thierry's lawn with a pot, and the ball can also be shaken off by one wicket.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the case of a big carry, the ti-up is often used, but the two sides of the ti-dora are used in a narrow hall and so on.</seg>
<seg id="12">You can use it in a hall where the eyes are down."</seg>
<seg id="13">A ballistic instrument recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carey.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why I don't need 3W. Caddy can be more comfortable with 3W than 3W.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood has only one W in his caddy bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is the 17-degree loft UT.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way the tourers are surprised, they are pleased to hear a leak from the gallery they see.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They're trying to get the club to a level".</seg>
<seg id="19">"If you hit a down blow, you won't fly straight. If you hit it with the upperside, you'll go right with the cut trajectory. Originally, you were doing a straight drum to correct the swing of a 1 W shot. This practice would slow the attack angle.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by the risk of slice, which means that the left side can be erased (but not bent to the left).</seg>
<seg id="21">I'll tell Kantan, but it's a professional technique I can't imagine.</seg>

<seg id="1">What kind of way to prevent dementia from leaving something like forgetting?</seg>
<seg id="2">News/Watanabe Yo</seg>
<seg id="3">A number of pharmaceutical companies and universities have attempted to develop the drug.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it has become apparent that the relationship between dementia and living habits is being elucidated, and there is a possibility that they may be able to remain extremely mild and forgetful.</seg>
<seg id="5">I talked to Professor Shunsuke OTSUKI at Kinki University Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">No dementia.</seg>
<seg id="7">- Dementia prevention or therapeutic medication is expected, but what is it?</seg>
<seg id="8">Otsuki, regardless of the degree of difference from mild to severe, may become dementia when everyone gets older.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drug Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance in some overseas countries, and is not expected to have any significant cure effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, people have become able to live longer, as mortality due to infection and accidents has decreased, and cancer death has decreased due to a variety of advances in the treatment of anticancer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not only possible to solve this problem by itself or by family, but also necessary to establish a community-wide environment where people can live comfortably in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method to keep things to the extent of forgetting.</seg>
<seg id="15">- Are there people who are susceptible to dementia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Otsuki, even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, you might be able to suppress the symptoms as much as you can, to the extent of forgetting things.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered to be one of the habits of life, and tends to be easier for people.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, people with metabolism tend to be prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as one of living habits.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also affects economic power.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food is available for freezing hamburgers, pizza and chicken.</seg>
<seg id="23">No gas or electricity can be used, and people who live in an environment where food is not available can be used in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetable and protein and becomes a life biased against lipids and sugars.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the end, she is very poor, but becomes obese, and when she does, she has no choice but to watch TV and her body becomes unlucky.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can be found in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">Other people who don't think about things and who don't work tend to be more likely to become dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day to think about things that are not metabolized.</seg>
