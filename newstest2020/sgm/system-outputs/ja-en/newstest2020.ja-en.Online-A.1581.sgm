<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Young people's misstep in pedaling accidents (Auto Mese Web) - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="3">Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for the elderly driver though the report of the accident by the wrong operation such as the misstep of the pedal increases and attention is paid attention.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the number of misstep accidents by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the highest number of mistopping accidents was 1080 people under the age of 24, exceeding 1032 cases over the age of 75.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mistakes are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you want to take the fashion of the foot?</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you want to take safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no description of the ratio and cause of men and women in this data, unlike the elderly people who are often thought to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, and careless mistakes in being distracted by other things such as music and conversation in young people, it is also conceivable to miss step due to clothes and the like.</seg>
<seg id="10">Especially, there is a person who chooses various shoes according to clothes of the day such as high heels, pumps, sandals, mules, and drives as it is.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility of leading to danger at all, and are driving without offense.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.</seg>
<seg id="13">Article 70, "Violation of duty to drive safely", which stipulates that "the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations must not be operated reliably" and "do not drive in a way that causes an accident and harms the person."</seg>
<seg id="14">And the other is Article 71, "Violation of Compliance with the Public Safety Commission," which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters specified by each prefectural Public Safety Commission, for example, in article 12 of the Enforcement Bylaws of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, "wearing footwear in a manner that may interfere with bald, slippers, tights, high heels, and other driving operations, or footwear in a manner that interferes with driving operations, and vehicles (excluding light vehicles). Do not drive. There is a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same applies to the effect that each prefecture considers driving in "footwear that may interfere with driving operation" is a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then, why is driving in high heels dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">It's obvious given the basics of pedaling safely.</seg>
<seg id="18">For safe and reliable pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot to the floor, place the foot so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal, when stepping on the accelerator pedal tilt the foot to the right as a support point.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to firmly fix the heel so as not to shake.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in high heels the area where the heel is grounded to the floor is small, and always blurring, because the angle is attached to the entire foot at the height of the heel, the area of the foot to be grounded to the pedal also can not be stepped firmly becomes smaller, it becomes difficult to fine adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is considered to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get caught heel heels of the high heel, or the pedal can not be stepped on when the heel is sudden braking, the high heel is removed at the time when the heel is caught, there is also a case where you can not step stuck in the back of the pedal.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the heel is caught in the back of the pedal when returning after stepping on the pedal, the accelerator pedal is no longer returned, there is also a case that.</seg>

<seg id="2">The sluggish housing market and the repeated earthquake damage also affected the progress of consumer tile roofs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 530173983, capital 99.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Kozo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone 06-6365-6038) and one others.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.</seg>
<seg id="6">Initially, we started our business as an ibushi tile manufacturer, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishi-Awacho (now Minami-Awaji City) in Mihara-gun, under the trade name of Ceramics Co., Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time moved its head office to its current trade name.</seg>
<seg id="8">After that, we opened sales bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. and it became the current system, and it was mainly made of ibushi tiles before, but now western tiles such as flat tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70% such as flat tiles and 30% of Japanese tiles such as ibushi tiles due to changes in consumer needs.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, the Company established a wide range of sales bases, mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies, and recorded annual sales of approximately 3,116 million yen in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a tile manufacturer of Awaji Island, it had a suitable name recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, demand for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 fell to approximately 1,345 million yen due to sluggish housing market conditions since the Lehman shock and the repeated damage to the earthquake, including the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="12">In terms of earnings, in addition to the decline in profit margins associated with soaring fuel prices, the company was forced to run into a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and capital investment, forcing a severe cash flow.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, although business restructuring was made by asking financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions for debt, there was no sign of recovery in business conditions, and the cash flow was gradually tight.</seg>
<seg id="14">After coming here, we gave up business continuity without support, and this measure was taken.</seg>
<seg id="15">Debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The real culprit" (FRIDAY) that droneed at Saudi Arabia oil facility - Yahoo! News</seg>
<seg id="2">"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Abbabir" used in this bombing has dramatically improved performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed U.S. military.</seg>
<seg id="3">It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is also a strength that it is difficult to be caught by radar because it flies low in the sky."</seg>
<seg id="5">On 14 September, an oil facility of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shortly after this, the Houthis, an anti-government organization in Yemen, issued a statement of the crime.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'm sure that what's behind the Houthis is Iran, led by President Rouhani. Iran cannot allow its own country to make money from crude oil in a situation where its hostilities are not exported. If we continue to embargo on crude oil against Iran, the aim is to inform the international community that the pain will be appropriate."</seg>
<seg id="8">Half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped in the wake of the bombing, with oil prices soaring by 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">At this rate, some people say that the oil shock will come back.</seg>
<seg id="10">"As Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, he wants to avoid military intervention at least until next year's election ends. After that is understood, Iran will continue to bomb drones with the Houthis behind them. But the United States can't stand it forever. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."</seg>

<seg id="1">The reason why the super-individual youTuber became a full-time employee.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!)</seg>
<seg id="3">9/27 (Fri) 8:47</seg>
<seg id="4">YouTuber is now extremely popular, especially among young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although it is not uncommon now for companies to use them for advertising their products, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber recruitment" in which employees are hired as full-time employees in-house.</seg>
<seg id="6">Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX) is mainly business of corporate customer relationship management (CRM).</seg>
<seg id="7">What does it mean to adopt a YouTuber?</seg>
<seg id="8">We spoke to Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX and representative of staff first, a subsidiary whose YouTuber was actually hired.</seg>
<seg id="9">I want to support young people who work hard to recruit YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="10">― How does "YouTuber recruitment" work in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="11">Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter Kobayashi) : The profession of YouTuber is now admiring many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also ranked high in the occupation rankings that elementary school students want to work in the future, and the number of young people who aim for it will increase rapidly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until now, we have recruited and supported young people who are chasing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" is about hiring and supporting young people who are chasing their dream of becoming a YouTuber.</seg>
<seg id="15">― ― There is an image that YouTubers are self-directed video posts by individuals, but why did you decide to "hire"?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers can't make the money they want.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTubers by their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this initiative, we will provide hired creators with an environment for salary and content creation.</seg>
<seg id="19">At first, we will support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the occupation of YouTuber, which makes you in an unstable position by all means.</seg>

<seg id="4">GSOMIA is the foundation for japan, South Korea, the United States, and South Korea to share information on missile launches.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Korea announced in August that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information between Japan and South Korea will collapse.</seg>

<seg id="8">He also expressed threat recognition of the joint flight drill conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July, saying it was "the first time in history," and said, "It is essential for the United States, South Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, to work together in an alliance."</seg>

<seg id="2">Jurgen Klopp, who won the Best Director award for The Best, looks back on his career in an interview and comments on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">What surprised the public with many of his remarks was about Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, his biggest rival in competing for the Premier League title.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neymar's best friend Alves says, "His happiness is still in Barca. 」</seg>
<seg id="5">After The Best's awards ceremony, the German commander said, "I never imagined anything so great. I am very happy and proud to have won this award. It was a great few days for me. Thanks to my players, I was able to win the prize. The most important thing is the team."</seg>
<seg id="6">As for Guardiola, Klopp said, "I respect him very much", and said, "What can I say about him?" He has won many titles. His style of play is extraordinary. He is the best coach I've ever played against, and it's an honor to be nominated with him and to compete for the award."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also mentions coach Pochettino and Tottenham.</seg>
<seg id="8">"His last year was incredibly great. In many cases, if you don't win the title, you won't be left in people's memory. We worked little by little to build the team and played in a great style".</seg>
<seg id="9">Klopp didn't hesitate about the best moments of 2019, but said: "It's a comeback against Barcelona. Many experts and myself would not have bet on us a centimeter. With a 3-0 behind against a team with Messi and Suarez . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It's like a death sentence. We had a small chance and we were able to make it. I couldn't believe it. Looking back, we might be able to say that we won the Champions League in this match. This game will be remembered by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked a more personal question, Klopp said: "When I congratulated him on winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. That didn't happen this time. I don't like to get drunk because I'm a person who has been plagued by self-management obsession. The blessing of winning the Champions League was very modest. I remember everything. If I were to line everyone up in front of me, I might be able to tell all the people I saw from the bus."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sakura shrimp born this year, which was successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay, on November 11, off Kambara, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka City (provided by the Yui Sakura Shrimp Project)</seg>
<seg id="3">The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, a council of marine industries and governments from Shizuoka City and other cities, recently succeeded in photographing cherry shrimp, which is believed to have been born during the spawning season of this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people concerned want to elucidate the ecology of sakura shrimp, which is often mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="5">The photo was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1.5 kilometers off the Kamobara area of Shimizu-ku, the same city.</seg>
<seg id="6">A total of about 300 animals were confirmed in 17 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">During the day, the conventional knowledge that cherry shrimp in the deep sea "forms a certain group at the bottom of the sea" was confirmed once again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The adult body is about 40 mm in length, and the individual reflected is about 23 mm in length.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spawning season was identified by matching the seasonal data of the landed cherry shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="10">For detailed analysis, we will ask Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College, which make up the team.</seg>
<seg id="11">Keisuke Mizuno, project leader, says, "We want to capture the living appearance of individuals in the growth process, including young shrimp."</seg>

<seg id="3">The Japan National Team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Basel, Switzerland), a big badminton event held in August, will compete in the China OP (Changzhou/Super1000), which starts on 17 September after a training camp in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">Looking back on the first half of the olympic race from May to August, when the Olympic games for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, we will look ahead to the midfield match (September to December) (Bun/Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).</seg>
<seg id="5">Badminton's Olympic race, which began in May, was held at the end of the world championships with four top athletes (Super 500 and above).</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first half, two players, Kento Momoda, who won two of the four tournaments, and Cho Zhou Tien chen of Taiwan were the two men who kept their performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momoda won the World Championship and Zhou Tengcheng won the Indonesia OP (S1000) in a tournament where high points of "world ranking points" that are directly connected to the Olympic race can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="8">Momoda also has a Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">Since May, the team competitions have been held: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/Results: 16 strong), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since August was only one world championship, fatigue will not be greater than during a series of matches.</seg>
<seg id="12">A good result is required in the midfield game where the top tournaments after September are consecutive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Taiwan's ace is strong in consecutive matches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pay attention to young Thai people!</seg>
<seg id="15">Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a player who is physically strong and doesn't have a hard time fighting consecutive matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem with the performance of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather, the fact that they earned high points in the first half would make it easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zhou Tiancheng had the impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but with a stronger sense of stability in terms of play this year, he has been able to continue to perform well.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Momoda, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, he is likely to be a more troublesome opponent than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to these two players, the result was in the first half of the match with Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Sai Pranies B. 。</seg>
<seg id="23">And it's Anders Antonsen, who is struggling alone as a European player.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Cantaphone has not reached the finals in the top tournaments, they have gained strength to advance to the top spot, including reaching the quarterfinals in two tournaments this season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 20-year-old (21 years old on the 18th), who is now able to rally on an equal footing with top athletes, seems to have a great potential to make a leap forward in the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sai Prranies B. took a step out of India with good players in the singles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S. And Slic cans Kidambi, who is behind due to injury, will catch up in the future, so the Indians need to be careful after the midfield game.</seg>

<seg id="1">New mobile phone rates to cut prices in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun</seg>
<seg id="2">A new rate plan for mobile phone companies has been put out in line with the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it was generally a high stop.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was no price competition despite growing expectations for a price cut, when Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Kan said last summer that there was room to drop the price by about 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed, and the main reason is that the three major companies continue to be olimonopoly.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition to make it easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="7">I want to ask for the effort of the mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revised law prohibits the set discount of the terminal fee and the communication fee.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reason is that the communication fee was set to be expensive instead of selling the terminal fee cheaply.</seg>
<seg id="10">SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to halve their devices at most.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, for 100 days, both companies have a "SIM lock" that cannot be used by other companies.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT DOCOMO will increase the cost of terminals by up to one-third for subscribers of its own line.</seg>
<seg id="13">All three companies seem to continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has indicated that it will require immediate release of SIM locks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies also need to respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the failure to improve the development of base stations and other communication networks as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a catalyst for the price cut competition, so it's a shoulder-to-shoulder look.</seg>
<seg id="18">There might have been a sweetness of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="19">The timing and fees for the start of the full-scale service have not been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.</seg>
<seg id="21">The revision of the fee was triggered by remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regarding the new rates of the three companies, Mr. Kan said, "I think competition will begin in the future. I don't think it's ok to leave it as it is."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is unlikely that the "government-made price cut" will distort the market and encourage sound competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before the government interferes with them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Each company's pricing structure is very complex and not easy to compare.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Consumer Affairs Agency has called attention to the case where the burden on consumers exceeds half of the case, even though the device is advertising "up to half the price."</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies must try to explain politely and in an easy-to-understand way so as not to create misunderstandings among users themselves.</seg>

<seg id="3">The United States, who made their last appearance in 20 participating countries, were beaten 7-45 by England for the Rugby World Cup in Japan on 26 August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although it was a black star start, the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half has caused a stir.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was sent off in a way that added a shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.</seg>
<seg id="6">The actual scene was also released by foreign media with videos, and the former England player also complained that it was "insulting and despicable play" and "not something that could be called a tackle."</seg>
<seg id="7">【Video】 "Insulting and sneaky play" and overseas ripples!</seg>
<seg id="8">One shot sent off, both military players are in a mess ... The actual moment of the "facial danger tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill</seg>
<seg id="9">A passionate fighting spirit has crossed the line.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was 0-38 in the 29th minute of the second half.</seg>
<seg id="11">England captain Farrell lost his balance as he caught his team's pass deep in the enemy's line.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Quill who went to tackle this.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the upper body was raised instead of the waist down, and the body was hit violently against the upper body.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the head and the head of the other party come into contact, and it becomes a shape like the head butt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pharrell was blown violently and fell down.</seg>
<seg id="16">The English player protested furiously to push Quill away from the play which was clearly lacking legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Both military players gathered at once, and it became an air of the impetuity at once.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the crowd, who wanted to play fair, booed him.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rugby powerhouse New Zealand's local media "staff" featured "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players sent off for sneaky play, England won comfortably" and featured it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Kill was sent off with a sneaky shoulder charge on the face of England star Farrell," reports the team said.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the article, we introduce the comments of Hugo Monya, a former England national team player and commentator.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's insulting and despicable. It is not something that can be called a tackle. It's a despicable play."</seg>
<seg id="24">The U.S., who lacked a single game, managed to escape the shutout loss with a willing try in the 81st minute.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were covered by Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Oda Hospital, Oda Hospital in Oda Hospital, Mikuni Town, Sakai City, Awara Hospital, Awara City, and Sowai City.</seg>
<seg id="3">⇒Four hospitals subject to reorganization "standards are wrong"</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to control medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it is necessary to encourage reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.</seg>
<seg id="5">In October, we will ask the target hospital to consider full-scale reorganization and integration, and we will ask them to draw a conclusion by September next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although it is not enforceable, there is expected to be a backlash from local chiefs and residents due to fears that there will be no hospitals close to them.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was announced at the meeting on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">The number of eligible hospitals was 29.1% of the total, and many hospitals had relatively few beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">By prefecture, the percentage was higher in Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).</seg>
<seg id="10">The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on data from fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to the "advanced acute phase" for critically ill patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nine medical records such as cancer and emergency medical care and the need to disclose the name of the hospital were determined by analyzing whether competing hospitals were in a location "within 20 minutes by car".</seg>
<seg id="13">The target hospital will be considered for abolition or transfer of some medical departments to other hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medical expenses will skyrocket in 25 years, when all baby boomers will be 75 years old or older.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in 1,246,000 hospitals (18 years) to 1,191,000 beds nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, there are a large number of beds in the "advanced acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are generously arranged and medical expenses are incurred, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation that is highly needed for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "Regional Medical Care Plan" that defines the number of beds required in 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The debate has been difficult, with local governments and medical officials dividing the country into 339 areas, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries today announced a proposed amendment to the Preventive Code that would allow preventive vaccination of domestic animal infectious diseases called "pork cholera" to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, where infections with pigs and wild boars have been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is limited in the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making public comments to the general public (public offering of opinions), the company aims to complete the procedure as early as October.</seg>
<seg id="6">By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution of meat and other products, it is no longer a "clean country" that has been certified by international organizations, which could affect pork exports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the outbreak in September last year, Japan has been temporarily on hold for the status of clean countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under the proposed amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has set the "recommended vaccination area" based on expert opinions on areas where there is a high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, how to proceed, etc., and will be approved for use at the governor's discretion after the ministry's confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures listed as recommended areas for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the guidelines are revised, the region will look at the situation and make another decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a general rule, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, waste, etc. is limited to the region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meat and processed products are not covered in light of the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and effectively allows distribution outside the region.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order not to spread the virus, thoroughly dispose of food waste.</seg>
<seg id="15">He appealed for the safety of inoculated pigs and worked to prevent reputational damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proposed amendment to the Guidelines was compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Health Prevention Headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the future, opinions and public comments will be conducted to prefectures until October 7, and new health protection guidelines will be implemented.</seg>

<seg id="3">9/28 (Sat) 2:57</seg>
<seg id="4">After leaving Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, former Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda, who is now independent, took an amazing role.</seg>
<seg id="5">[Movie] Keisuke Honda, was you actually in the game?</seg>
<seg id="6">The truth of the astonishment is revealed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan time, said, "Please give me an offer. We don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."</seg>
<seg id="8">The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" was manchester United, the world's most famous.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the best clubs in the Premier League?</seg>

<seg id="5">The loan destinations are 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.</seg>
<seg id="6">Naka-ku accounts for 60% of the total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Now Naodora master Hiroyo Ikemura does not need to tee up even the first hit?</seg>
<seg id="2">Today's Caddy's Best Shot</seg>
<seg id="3">1W shots are not necessarily tee-ups.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also a technique called "Naodora" that hits the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance, such as the second hit of the par 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent 1W, there is a risk that the ball will scatter due to the large head volume, but there are players who often practice this on the tee ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hiroyo Ikemura is waiting for his first tour victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a pro, is 166cm tall and is currently ranked 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).</seg>
<seg id="8">While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was fairway wood accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="9">In early spring, he opened his eyes, saying, "I didn't like the shot of the spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try a straight Dora."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the turf of the tee area, and it is likely to shake off 1W.</seg>
<seg id="11">In cases where big carry is required, tee-up is used a lot, but both sides make effective use of straight Dora in narrow holes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It can be used in holes where eyes are down."</seg>
<seg id="13">In the ballistic instrument, 270yd to 280yd is recorded with carry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"That's why I don't need 3W. Caddy is also more secure than 3W. 」 。</seg>
<seg id="15">From the Japan Tour Championship in June, there are only 1W wood in the caddy bag.</seg>
<seg id="16">The second longest club is the 17-degree UT in the loft.</seg>
<seg id="17">The strategy, which is surprising to fellow tour members, is also a joyful voice of admiration leaking from the gallery you've seen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trick is to swing the club to the level.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Whether it's a down blow or a hit on the upper, it doesn't fly straight. If it is a cut trajectory, it goes to the right. Originally, I was doing a straight Dora to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tee-up). In this practice, the attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club) will also be moderated."</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not caught and involves the risk of slicing, but "so the left side can be erased (not turning to the left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">I'll tell you in a simply way, but... And, it is a professional technique which becomes involuntarily.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to prevent dementia and keep it to the extent of "forgetting"?</seg>
<seg id="2">Interview/Text/ Yo Watanabe</seg>
<seg id="3">A drug for dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is being elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it is possible to keep it to the extent that it is extremely mild and forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="5">We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of The Stroke Center, University Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia doesn't go away</seg>
<seg id="7">― Dementia prevention or therapeutic drugs are long-awaited, but what is the current situation?</seg>
<seg id="8">Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a possibility that everyone will develop dementia as they age, regardless of the degree of difference.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years for a new dementia drug to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drug Donepezil, which is often used in Japan, is already out of insurance in some countries overseas, and the effect of a remarkable complete cure is not expected.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to remarkable advances in the treatment of anticancer drugs, people have been able to live longer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, it is also true that the number of people with dementia is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind, rather than being able to solve problems only by the individual and his/her family.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep it to the extent of "forgetfulness"</seg>
<seg id="15">― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are less likely to become?</seg>
<seg id="16">Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable that you will develop dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay to the extent that you forget things.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and there is a tendency for people who are more likely to become it.</seg>
<seg id="18">First of all, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.</seg>

<seg id="21">The presence or absence of economic power will also be affected.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in some areas of the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food that can be served is frozen hamburgers, pizzas, and chicken that can be stored.</seg>
<seg id="23">It can be used by people who cannot use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place.</seg>

<seg id="25">Before long, he became obese even though he was in poverty, and when it came to doing things, he had no choice but to watch TV and become crippled.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar situation can be in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to be prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis, not to become metabolic syndrome.</seg>
