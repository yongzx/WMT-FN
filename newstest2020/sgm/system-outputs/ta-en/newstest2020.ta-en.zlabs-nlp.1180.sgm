<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But there is no mere appreciation that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have provided a new dimension and a clear ideology for revolutionary movements and thereby Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see today that there is a perception among people that the revolutionaries were just fools and stone-throwers who didn't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The period of Bhagat Singh gives us an insight into their humanity and ability to think clearly.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 1929, the name was used for the first time in the United States, and the name was used for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was only in 1930 that the public was able to find out more about it.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of making his debut, his fame spread rapidly in all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most astonishing news in history, the name of any leader born in the North, including Gandhi, has never spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's because they are the parents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial was published in the republican weekly under the headline Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and made some comments about the political climate of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some parts of the base are as follows:-</seg>
<seg id="13">'In fact, Bhagat Singh ji was very confident that he would correct all his policies and that the models he was working on would be the right way forward and if he were to decide, we would say that he must have behaved accordingly and if he had not behaved like that, he would not have been a man of yogurt.</seg>
<seg id="14">So now we will call him a true man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that it is indeed the policy of Bhagat Singh to India.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been executed and martyred, there would not have been any evidence that this success could have been caused by such popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">If we had not executed Bhagat Singh, we would say that Gandhi too would have been in a state of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bhagat Singh, who was diagnosed with chlamydia and had to be dumped to death, had more than his life to show the people of India why he had a path to true equality and peace for the people of the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a statement issued by the party's Treasurer Durai Murugan, he criticized the Chief Minister for declining to disclose any details of his public duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">DMK Treasurer Duraimurugan said in his statement that the water being opened in Kaveri is wasted in the sea due to the indifference of the A.D.M.K. government and lack of administrative capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our leader M. K. Stalin expressed his concern that the A.D.M.K. government had no concrete plan in place to detain and store Cauvery's passing, in the interest of holding him accountable as the Leader of Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Edapadi Palaniswami, who thought he was answering to the Chief Minister, asked, 'Have the DMK Warriors, who blame us, built a barricade in Kaveri during their rule?'</seg>
<seg id="6">"I want to tell him that we have built a barrier under the TMC regime at Mayanur in Kaveri.</seg>

<seg id="11">As per the requirements of that period, a barricade was built by the Mayanur Corporation government.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, there was no need to build more barricades.</seg>
<seg id="13">If there was a need, then the then Chief Minister, Kalaignar ji, would have immediately sanctioned it, set aside funds and stepped up the task.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, there is no such thing as edappadi to blame the club's government for maintaining the welfare of the saviour.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask: how many barricades have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years of the A.D.M.K. rule?</seg>
<seg id="16">We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK's reign.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to at least one dam as the dam built in the A.D.M. regimes that has happened so far?</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">The leader of the opposition has responded to their accusation by saying, with evidence, that we are building barricades or planning to build barricades in other places.</seg>
<seg id="20">In spite of the fact that there was no vacancy built in Kaveri under the rule of DMK, I am obliged to point out that the post of the Chief Minister may be beautifully done, not civilised and not aesthetically pleasing.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Does BJP have a foothold in Tamil Nadu's politics?</seg>
<seg id="2">If you can't put a lot of spin and tar in Tamil Nadu, then finally caste politics is supposed to be in the hands of the BJP.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi became prime minister for the first time, he had to leave Thamarai in Tamil Nadu to see Duzhavi.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this, for the second time in a row, Amit Shah condemned the result of the last MP elections, saying, "You don't know what you will make of it. Tamarai should be settled in Tamil Nadu."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in all 5 contested seats, only dust was attracted.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the macabre macabre protests across the country, there is still a wave of protest in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all triple talaq, Kashmir issue, Hindi imposition, One Nation is one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since everything has been put together like this, there is still a lot to be found.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why the BJP leadership is reportedly on the cusp of overhauling the Tamil Nadu BJP administrators and that's why it's so complicated that not even the state leadership can be appointed yet.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the one hand, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu somehow before the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems that the BJP leadership has come to an almost certain conclusion through direct field rapport, intelligence rapport and so on.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, the idea that the 2 Dravidian parties, be it the AIADMK or the DMK, are not sufficiently important to the people of Nadar, the people of Vanniyar and the Velayar of Devendra Kula is prevalent in their respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is said to have upset Dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">This suit has been started with a bazooka tactical handshake.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has decided to honor the status quo by giving a post in a manner that glorifies or promotes the respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soundararajan's nomination of Tamil musician as the Governor of Telangana is one such thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be giving importance to the nominees for the top post at ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">As such, it is true that if the BJP acts in honour of every ethnicity, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of their respective ethnicities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, one thing that does not matter is that in this caste politics, the BJP will do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, at a time when Tamil Nadu is already reeling from caste politics, it is not known if these actions by Bajak will be enough to pour more oil on the burning fires.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if caste fires started like this, even the baldness of Thamarai, which is now a little bit bruised in Tamil Nadu, would get blackened in the same fire!</seg>
