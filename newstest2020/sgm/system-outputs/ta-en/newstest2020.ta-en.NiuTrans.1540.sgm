<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is not just a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are just fools and are uneducated people who don't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The period of Bhagat Singh reminds us of his humanitarianism, clarity of thought and skill.</seg>
<seg id="5">On April 29, 1929, after the assembly bombing, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was not until the 1930s that he became known to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to every corner of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most surprising news in history that the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi, has not spread to Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's because of Father Periyar.</seg>
<seg id="10">The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in the Republic Weekly entitled Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character's interests and made some comments on the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some passages from the Athalayang are as follows: -</seg>
<seg id="13">"In fact, if Bhagat Singh ji is convinced that all his principles are right and the models he has done are the right way to fulfill them, we will say that if he has decided then he will definitely have to follow his footsteps and if he has not done so, he will not be able to say that he is a healthy person.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now we're going to call him a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that India really needs Bhagat Singh's policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and survived, there would not have been any evidence that this victory would have been so popular.</seg>
<seg id="17">And, if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still have had a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="18">For Bhagat Singh, who had to be sick or sick, why should a mother be able to show the people of India the path of true equality and peace for the people of the world?</seg>
<seg id="19">We applaud Bhagat Singh for saying that it is a great achievement that no one else can achieve by ordinary means! "</seg>

<seg id="3">The meeting was held on 28.9.2019 under the chairmanship of Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal, with the Directors of 23 IITs functioning under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision taken at that meeting has shocked the students and the general public.</seg>
<seg id="5">A decision has been taken to increase the fees for M.Tech in AID institutions by 10 times.</seg>
<seg id="6">In all the AIDs in India, only Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 50,000 per semester is being charged.</seg>
<seg id="7">At this stage, the fee has now been increased to Rs. 2 lakh per annum.</seg>
<seg id="8">Out of the 12 AIRM students studying for the first year in the academic year 2019-2020, 9,280 students are eligible for scholarship and it has also been decided to withhold the monthly grant of 12,400 rupees to the students.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will reduce the funds provided by the Central Government to AIDs in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Roorkee and Guwahati.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Government of India has increased the fees to collect the funds from the students to meet the reduction in the amount.</seg>
<seg id="11">Further, it is said that the Ministry has been instructed to take up the development work of the respective institutions by keeping the proceeds from the construction works carried out by the respective technical institutes and also to borrow money from the bank and get the funds from the corporate entities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since coming to power, the BJP has been preventing the common man from getting access to education as much as possible, reducing the funding for primary education in the 2015 budget, followed by a massive reduction in the funding for education during one budget.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was followed by continuous flow of big business to set up educational institutions in order to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="14">At this stage, the new education policy has put in place a number of rules to ensure that educational institutions are funded by private institutions without giving any importance to public educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">With this, the central government is trying to push only the privileged from basic education to higher education and take India's rich future back centuries as an illiterate nation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The DMK has questioned Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami about the number of check posts built under the AIADMK regime over the past eight years.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement issued by the party's treasurer Thuraimurugan, he criticised the CM for not knowing any details about the public service sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his statement, DMK treasurer Thuraimurugan said that the water that is being opened up in the Cauvery is flowing into the sea in vain due to the apathy of the ADMK government and lack of administrative skills.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our leader MK Stalin had expressed his concern about the responsibility of the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly that there was no concrete plan for the ADMK government to stop the Cauvery crossing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thinking that he would answer the CM, Edappadi Palaniswami asked, "Did the DMK people who are criticising us build a barracks in the Cauvery under their rule?"</seg>
<seg id="6">"I want to inform him that under the DMK regime, we have built a barricade at Mayanur in the Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="7">Can Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who is also in charge of the public works department without even knowing the details, speak out of the truth?</seg>
<seg id="8">The earth's water resources were increased in the area due to the construction of the barracks in Mayanur.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why agriculture has flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore, thousands of people from the farming community of that region, who are still benefiting from it, can always be seen thanking the government of the Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The barracks were built in Mayanur as per the requirement of the period.</seg>
<seg id="12">At that time, there was no need to build more barracks.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the need had been there, then the then Chief Minister Kalaignar Ji would have immediately given permission, set aside funds and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, Edapadi has nothing to do with criticizing the club government for the welfare of Kaveri.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask: How many barracks have you built in the Cauvery during the last eight years of the AIADMK regime?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question: During the reign of DMK, we built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to at least one dam that has been built in the ADMK regime so far?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">If there is a reply to the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition, please find out with the evidence that we are building barricades or planning to build barricades at these places.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead, I am obliged to point out that the DMK regime has not built a barracks in the Cauvery, it may be beautiful if it is rooted in personal weight, it is not civilized or beautiful for the post of chief minister he holds, "said Thuraimurugan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does the BJP take up caste politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Whatever be the case in Tamilnadu, it is said that the BJP will finally take up caste politics if it is not able to keep the lotus blossoming.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, there was a situation in Tamil Nadu where he had to leave his hand and watch Tamar.</seg>
<seg id="4">After that, for the second time, during the ongoing MP elections, Amit Shah said, "I don't know what to do and I want Thamarai to bloom in Tamil Nadu."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, only five of the contested constituencies were able to win the soil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though there is a lot of baggage all over the country, there is a wave of protests in Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">Above all, the issue of triple talaq, Kashmir, imposition of Hindi, one nation, one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">When all of this is done, it is still visible.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why it is said that the BJP leadership is so angry with the Tamilnadu BJP executives that even the state leadership is still unable to be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even though this is on the one hand, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu in the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BJP leadership seems to have come to a close with a direct field report, intelligence report and so on.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the respective communities that the two Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the people of Nadar, Vanniar and Devendra Kula Vellalar.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is said that the Dravidian parties are in a state of regret.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is the formula that has been adopted by the BJP as a tactic.</seg>
<seg id="15">They have decided to honour their respective communities by giving them a position of pride or importance.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Tamil Nadu Soundarajan as Governor of Telangana is one such thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is also giving importance to the top-ranking Nadars of ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a manner that it honors every race then it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, there is nothing that doesn't matter, this caste will only make a mockery of the BJP in politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already embroiled in caste politics, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will become like pouring more oil into the burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn, even the bald of Tamar, who is now suffering a little loss in Tamilnadu, will be burnt in the same fire!</seg>
