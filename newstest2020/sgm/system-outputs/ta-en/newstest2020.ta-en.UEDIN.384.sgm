<seg id="1"> There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2"> But it is not just praise that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given revolutionary movements and thereby a new dimension and clear ideology to Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We can see today that there is a consensus among the masses that the revolutionaries are just fools and stones that don't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Bahad Singh era reminds us of their humanity, their thoughtfulness and their ability to do so.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In April 1929, after the Legislative Bombing, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even in Tamil Nadu, it was introduced to the public in 1930.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But within a year of making his debut, his reputation has rapidly spread to all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is the most amazing news in history, and the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.</seg>
<seg id="9"> That's because of the father Periyar.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The week after Bhagat Singh's death, an editorial was published in the Republican Weekly, titled Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and made some points about the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Some parts from the portal:-</seg>
<seg id="13"> 'In fact, if he had decided that Bhagat Singh ji was right about all his policies and had done the right thing, we would have said that if he had decided that the right way would have been the right way, he would certainly have done the right thing, and if he had not done that, he would not have been able to say that he was a man of yardstick.</seg>
<seg id="14"> So now we will call him a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our strongest aspiration is that India's devotion to devotion is in fact the policy of devotion.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been executed and survived, there would not have been any evidence that this victory would have been caused by so much popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17"> And we will say that if it had not been for the execution of Bhagat Singh, Mahatma Gandhi would have been much more productive.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Why should a mother be able to show the way of genuine equality and peace to the people of the world to the devotion of the people of India, who should have died of a disease or self-inflicted disease, be able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> We admire Bhagat Singh for his generosity, demeanour and handicraft, saying that it is a great achievement that no one else can achieve by ordinary means!</seg>

<seg id="8"> Of the 12 Ai Ram students who have been studying for the first year of the 2019-2020 academic year, 9,280 are eligible for scholarships. M Tech has also decided to cut the monthly scholarships to 12,400 rupees.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karakpur, Kanpur, Rurgei and Guwahati will reduce the central government's funding to AIITs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The federal government has raised the cost of collecting the funds from students in order to tackle the reduction in funding.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, it is said that the Ministry has instructed them to take up development work, borrow money from the bank and get payment from the corporations, in order to keep the amount available through the construction work done by their respective technical institutes.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Since coming to power, the BJP has been preventing access to education for the common man as much as possible, cutting funding for primary education in the 2015 budget, followed by a drastic reduction in funding for education during every budgetary year.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This was followed by a continuation of the launch of large-scale educational institutions in order to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> At this point, the new education policy has imposed a series of rules that allow educational institutions to operate financially in private companies without giving any significance to the state educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This means that only those who are comfortable will be able to study from basic education to higher education and bring India's prosperous future back centuries as an illiterate country.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The DM has questioned Chief Minister Narendra Modi about how many barricades have been constructed in the last eight years of the AIADMK regime.</seg>
<seg id="2"> In a statement, the party's Treasurer Thurirumurugan criticised the CM for spying without any details of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="3"> DM Treasurer Durumurugan said in a statement that the water that is being opened at the Kaveri is in vain because of the DMK government's disinterest - and the lack of administrative capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Our leader, M.K. Stalin, expressed his concern that the U.K. government had no concrete plan to prevent it from passing through the Caucasus and that he was responsible for being the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu legislature.</seg>
<seg id="5"> When he thought he was answering the Chief Minister, he said, "DMK, who is criticising us, has built a detention centre in the Kaveri under their rule?"</seg>
<seg id="6"> "What I want to tell him is that under the DMK regime, we have constructed a barricade in Mayanur in Kaveri.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Without even knowing the details, will Chief Minister Edmund Palanichami, who also holds the public service department in charge, speak out against the truth?</seg>
<seg id="8"> The bar, which was built in Mayanur, increased the earth's water resources in the area.</seg>
<seg id="9"> So agriculture flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10"> So today, thousands of people in that region's farmer population can be seen thanking the Corporate Government for ever and ever.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The barricade was built by the Corporation Government in Mayanur as required in that time frame.</seg>
<seg id="12"> At the time, there was no need to build more barriers.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Had it been necessary, the then Chief Minister, Kalaignar Ji would have immediately given permission, allocated funds and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore, it is not easy for God to blame the Corporate Government for the welfare of the Kaveri.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I ask, how many barricades have you built in Ghairi in the last eight years when the DMK regime is taking place?</seg>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DM regimes.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Can you point to at least one dam, the dam constructed in the DMK regimes, that has happened so far?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="19"> If the opposition leader has any answers to their accusation - tell the sources that we are either building a barrier or planning to build a wall in other places.</seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition to that, I am obliged to point out that the detention under the DMK regime has not been constructed, that it may be fair for individual Goddess, and that it is not a civilised act, nor a beauty," Durumurugan said.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The White House has confirmed that it is true that Donald Trump has telephoned the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is likely to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Thus, an impeachment motion has been proposed against Trump in the House of Representatives on behalf of the Democratic Party, claiming that it was wrong to pressure other countries to investigate the US president.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Six committees have been set up on the orders of Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy and an investigation into the President's actions has begun.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At this point, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Voltaire Zelinsky by telephone on 25 July, so investigate," Trump said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Yesterday, the White House officially released a statement about what the two presidents were talking about.</seg>
<seg id="7"> So it has been acknowledged that what happened in the conversation is true.</seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, speaking to reporters outside the United Nations meeting, Donald Trump said the request was made friendly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said there was no pressure on the Ukrainian president.</seg>
<seg id="10"> But one thing to note is that the U.S. government suddenly suspended nearly $400 million worth of financial aid to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Then, a few days later, it allocated the funds.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Does the BJP take over the nation's politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2"> At the end of the day, the BJP is supposed to take the caste politics into the hands of the Tamil Nadu, wherever it may be, and wherever it may be, and if it can't let the camaraderie flourish, then the BJP will be in the hands of the caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> When Modi was Prime Minister for the first time, he had to abandon Tamarai in Tamil Nadu and look for a vasectomy.</seg>
<seg id="4"> After that, for the second time, in the run-up to the elections, Amit Shah said, "You don't know what you're doing. You have to flourish in Tamilnadu."</seg>
<seg id="5"> However, in the five contested constituencies, only soil was able to wash.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Despite the BJP's meltdown across the country, there is a wave of protest in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This is above all Triple Talaq, Kashmir issue, Hindi imposition, one nation one language.</seg>
<seg id="8"> All of this is still in tune with the fact that it's all together.</seg>
<seg id="9"> That's why the BJP leadership is in trouble with the BJP executives in Tamil Nadu, and that's why there is still a problem with even the state leadership being appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Despite this, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu as soon as possible in the upcoming legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> For that, the BJP leadership seems to have come to an almost unanimous conclusion through the Direct Field Rifle, Intelligence Rifle etc.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Accordingly, the two Dravida parties, whether it is the AIADMK or the DMK, do not give enough importance to the people of Nader, the people of the Vannis and the peoples of Devendra Kutcher, to the people of their respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This is said to be saddening for the Dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It is the BJP that is starting to take this magic into their own hands.</seg>
<seg id="15"> It has decided to honour and give a post of pride, or significance to their community.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Soundarajan's appointment as Governor of Telangana is also such a thing.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Likewise, the BJP government is also said to have given priority to high-ranking nationals in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18"> It is true that if the BJP does this to honour every ethnicity, then the people of those communities will get pride and happiness.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Moreover, one of the things that doesn't matter is that the BJP will be masquerading as a masquerade in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20"> At the same time, while Tamil Nadu is already embroiled in caste politics, it is not known whether the BJP's actions will be like pouring more oil into the burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If the caste fire starts to burn, it's true that even Tamar's flesh in Tamil Nadu will be poured into the same fire with a little bit of poison now!</seg>
