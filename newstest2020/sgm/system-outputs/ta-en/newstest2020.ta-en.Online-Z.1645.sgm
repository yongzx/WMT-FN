<seg id="1">Is BJP taking the caste politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Anyway in Tamil Nadu, if it is not able to keep lotus to keep lotus bloom, at last it is said that the caste politics in the hands.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was the prime minister for the first time, it was in a situation to abandon lotus in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this, for the 2th time, I mean during the mp election, " don't know what to do. Amit Shah said that lotus flower should be solved in Tamil Nadu</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the soil was finished in the 5 constituencies of contested.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though the whole country is liked by BJP, the opposition wave is only in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all triple talaq, Kashmir issue, hindi stuffing, one nation one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">As all these things are together, it is still found in the wall.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why bjp chief is in anger against tamilnadu bjp administrators and because of this there is a problem that there is still a state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even though this is on one side, BJP is planning to let BJP leave BJP in Tamil Nadu somehow within the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that, it seems that BJP leadership has come to an end through direct field report, intelligence report.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to that, whether it is admk or dmk or dmk, the thought that 2 Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to nadar community people, and devendra community people, and devendra community people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because of this it is said that they are sad about dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">This heat is what BJP has started to implement this heat in his hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">He decided to honor the community to honor, or to honor the community.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tamilisai Soundararajan's appointment is also such a governor of Telangana.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, it is said that the BJP government has given importance to the nadar who are in high position in isro.</seg>
<seg id="18">If BJP acts to honor every race like this, it is true that it will make the people get pride and happiness for those community.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, something that does not matter will make BJP in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu has become small behind in caste politics, it is not sure if these activities of BJP will become like blowing more oil in the burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if the caste fire starts burning, it is true that even the lotus bud which is blooming in Tamil Nadu will also be burnt in the same fire!</seg>
