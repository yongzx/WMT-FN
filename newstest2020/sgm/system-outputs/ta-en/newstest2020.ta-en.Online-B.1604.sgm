<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yet it is not mere praise that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see a perception among the people that the revolutionaries were just fools and did not care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bhagat Singh period gives us a sense of their humanity and clear thinking and ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bhagat Singh's name spread in India after the April 1929 assembly bombing.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was introduced to the public only in 1930, a little further away in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most amazing news in history, the name of any leader born in the North, including Gandhi, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Periyar is the reason for that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The week after Bhagat Singh was assassinated, an editorial appeared in the Republican weekly entitled Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character interests and made some comments on the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Excerpts from the editorial: -</seg>
<seg id="13">"Indeed, we will say that Bhagat Singh was convinced that they were right in all his principles and that the models he followed were the right religion to carry out, and that if he had decided that he should have behaved as he did, he would not have been a decent man if he had not done so.</seg>
<seg id="14">So now we will call him a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our strong opinion is that India really needs the Bhagat Singh policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Had Bhagat Singh not been hanged and survived, this victory would not have been so popular.</seg>
<seg id="17">And let us say that if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still have been created.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why did Bhagat Singh, who had to die of self-inflicted illness and ashes, spend more than his life as a useful mother to show the Indian people the path to true equality and peace for the people of the world?</seg>
<seg id="19">We applaud Bhagat Singh heartily, vaiyara, kaiyara, saying that he is a majority that no one else can achieve by ordinary means! "</seg>

<seg id="1">Is BJP engaging in caste politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">It is said that the BJP will eventually take over caste politics if it is not possible to put a lotus flower anywhere in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, he was in a position to leave the lotus in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the second time since then that Amit Shah has said, "I don't know what to do. The lotus flower should bloom in Tamil Nadu."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in all the 5 constituencies contested, Manna was the only one to win.</seg>
<seg id="6">Though the BJP is being praised all over the country, there is still a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is above all Muthalak, Kashmir affair, Hindi dump, one nation one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">With everything like this coming together it is still seen in the dry.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is said to be under heavy pressure on Tamil Nadu BJP executives and as a result there is still a problem where even the state leadership cannot be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the one hand, the BJP is planning to somehow root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the time of the forthcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems that the BJP leadership has almost come to a conclusion through direct field report, intelligence report and the like.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, there is a perception among the people of the respective communities that neither the AIADMK nor the DMK, the 2 Dravidian parties, give enough importance to the Nadar people, the Vanni people and the Devendra Kula Vellalar people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thus Dravidian parties are also said to be upset.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is this subtlety that the BJP is beginning to tackle and implement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Has decided to honor a post in a way that glorifies, or emphasizes, the respective community race.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Tamilisai Saundarajan as the Governor of Telangana is one such case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is said to be giving prominence to Nadars in high positions in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a way as to honor every race, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective races.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, something that is not tainted in any matter will tarnish the BJP in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, at a time when Tamil Nadu is already fragmented in caste politics, it is not clear whether these activities of the BJP will be like pouring more oil on a burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn, even the bud of the lotus flower which is now a little poisonous in Tamil Nadu will be burnt in the same fire!</seg>
