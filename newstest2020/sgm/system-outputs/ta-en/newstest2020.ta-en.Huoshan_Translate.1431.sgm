<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is not just a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his friends have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see today that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are just fools and that they are stonewallers who don't care about human life.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bhagat Singh era conveys to us their humanity and clear thinking and capability.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the bombing of the Legislative Council in April 1929, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was not until the 1930s that it became known to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his popularity had spread rapidly across all corners of Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most surprising news in history and the name of any North Indian-born leader, including Gandhi, has not spread in such a short time in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reason for this is because of their father.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in Republic Weekly entitled Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character interests and offered some ideas about the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Excerpts from the editorial include: -</seg>
<seg id="13">"In fact, Bhagat Singh ji had made sure that his whole ideology was correct and the models he had behaved in order to accomplish it were the right way and if he had decided not to, we would definitely say that he should have behaved the way he had behaved and if that had not happened then he would not have been able to say that he was a wise person.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, we must now say that he is a true person.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our strongest opinion is that India really needs the Bhagat Singh ideology.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been executed and died, there would have been no evidence that this victory would have been caused by such popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Let us say that if Bhagat Singh had not been executed, Gandhi would still have been inspired.</seg>
<seg id="18">For Bhagat Singh, who must have suffered from self-inflicted illness and died of ashes, why did a useful mother lose her life to show the true path of equality and peace to the people of the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">We heartily congratulate Bhagat Singh on being a great accomplishment that no one else can achieve. "</seg>

<seg id="7">The Minister informed the Parliament on 7th June that the Ministry of Education had submitted suggestions and recommendations regarding the pay dispute between the teachers and the Principals to the appointed Ranukke Committee on the general pay dispute within the Government Service.</seg>

<seg id="7">Ranu has produced a number of students through the Cartoon Research and Education Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In general, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by the family.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cartoonist Ranu, on the other hand, is credited with bringing out the book he has written since his death and the family themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even if Ranu passed away, he would have lived through his work and through this book for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy how many barricades have been built during the last 8 years of AIADMK rule.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement, the party's treasurer Duraimurugan criticised the Chief Minister for not knowing any details about the public works sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">DMK treasurer Duraimurugan said in a statement that the water being opened in Cauvery is being mixed in waste due to the indifference of the ADMK government and lack of administrative competence.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our chairman MK Stalin had expressed his concern that the ADMK government had no concrete plans to store it on the way through Cauvery and that it was the opposition leader of the Tamilnadu Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thinking of replying to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palanisamy said, "Did the DMK who blame us, have they built at least a barricade in Cauvery under their rule?"</seg>
<seg id="6">"I would like to inform him that under the DMK regime, we have built a barricade at Mayanur in Cauvery under the Kazhagam regime.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without even knowing the details, can the Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who has put the public services department in charge, speak out of the truth?</seg>
<seg id="8">With that barrier built in Mayanur, the water resources of the earth increased in that area.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why farming flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore, thousands of farmers of that region who still benefit today can always be seen thanking the Kazhagam government.</seg>
<seg id="11">During that period, the barricade was built in Mayanur by the Kazhagam government.</seg>
<seg id="12">At that time, there was no need to build more barricades.</seg>
<seg id="13">If necessary, the then Chief Minister Kalaignar ji would have given permission immediately, allocated funds and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, in maintaining the well-being of Cauvery, there is nothing close to Edapadi blaming the Kazhagam government.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask, how many barricades have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years of the ADMK government?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question: We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK era.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you pinpoint a single dam as the dam built in the ADMK regimes that has happened so far?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">If there is a response to the allegation made by the leader of the opposition, please tell us with the evidence that we are building or planning to build barricades in these places if there is a response.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thereafter, I am obliged to point out that under the DMK regime, talking outside the truth that the barricade itself has not been built in Cauvery, it may be beautiful if you want personal editing, it is not a civilised act or beautiful act for the Chief Minister position he holds, "Duraimurugan said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does BJP take caste politics into its own hands in Tamilnadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Somehow in Tamilnadu, caste politics is supposed to be taken into the hands of the BJP if it is not possible to hammer and lotus flowers anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, there was a situation in Tamil Nadu where he had to watch Lotus hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this, for the second time, only during the MP elections, Amitsha said with conviction, "You don't know what to do. You have to blossom in Tamilnadu."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, only five of the contested constituencies could attract soil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though the whole country is cheering the BJP, there is a wave of protests in Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all the issues of Triple Talaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, one nation is one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since everything has been combined, it is still visible in smoothness.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is so tight-lipped on the BJP executives in Tamil Nadu that even the state leadership cannot be appointed yet.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even though this is on one hand, the BJP is planning to root the BJP in Tamilnadu somehow within the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is understood that the BJP leadership has come to a virtual conclusion through direct field reports, intelligence reports etc.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, whether AIADMK or DMK, there are two Dravidian parties that do not give enough importance to the people of Nadar, to the people of Vanniyar community and to the people of Devendra Kula farmer community.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is said that the Dravidian parties are unhappy with this.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is this witchcraft that the BJP has started trickling into action.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Prime Minister said that in order to make the respective communities proud or important, he had decided to honour them with a post.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tamilisai Soundarajan's appointment as the governor of Telangana is a similar one.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is giving importance to the high-ranking Nadars in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a manner to honour every race, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, something that is not respectful of any subject will only benefit the BJP in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already in the midst of caste politics, it is not known whether these activities of BJP will become like pouring more oil into the burning fires.</seg>
<seg id="21">If such a caste fire starts to burn, it is true that even the total of the lotus that is now blossoming in Tamilnadu will burn into the same fire.</seg>
