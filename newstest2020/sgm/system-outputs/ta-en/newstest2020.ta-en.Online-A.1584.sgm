<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is not merely a discredit that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given revolutionary movements and thereby a new evolution and clear ideology to Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can see that there is a view among the people that revolutionaries are mere fools and are stonehearted people who do not care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bhagat Singh's period shows us their humanity, clear thinking and ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the april 1929 assembly bombing, bhagat singh name spread to India.</seg>
<seg id="6">He made his public debut in 1930, a little further away from Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his introduction, his fame has spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most surprising news in history, and no northernborn leader, including Gandhiji, has not been named in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.</seg>
<seg id="9">That was because of Thanthai Periyar.</seg>
<seg id="10">The week after Bhagat Singh's assassination, an editorial in the Republic weekly, entitled Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised bhagat singhs character and made some comments on the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Excerpts from the editorial:-</seg>
<seg id="13">"We would say that bhagat singh really was the right way to fulfill all his principles and that if he had decided he would have to be the same and that if he had not done so, he would not be a man of right.</seg>
<seg id="14">So now we will call him a true man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that The Bhagat Singh Policy is really what India needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. S. S. Had Bhagat Singh not been hanged and died, there would have been no evidence of this victory by so much popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">And if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhiwould have been more creative.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bhagat Singh, who was merely a disease dying of his own disease, had to die for his life as a mother who could be useful to show the people of India the path of genuine equality and peace to the people of the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">We congratulate Bhagat Singh with heartfelt praise for his words and words as a great blessing that no one else can achieve by ordinary.'</seg>

<seg id="6">"I want to inform him, The. M. During the Kamaraj rule, we built a check dam at Mayanur in Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="7">Can Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who has also held the Public Works Department without even knowing the details, speak untruthfully?</seg>

<seg id="4">After this, for the second time, i.e. the ongoing MP elections, he said, "I don't know what you're going to do. Lotus should bloom in Tamil Nadu," Amit Shah said sternly.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in all the five constituencies, the soil was only able to be soiled.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entire country is admiring the BJP but there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is above all triple talaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, one nation one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">All this is combined and it is still in the grim ness.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is in a state of disgust with the bjp officials in Tamil Nadu and that is why it is said that even the state leadership is not yet appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu before the coming assembly polls.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BJP leadership seems to have come to a close decision through the direct field report, intelligence report etc.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the community that the two Dravidian parties, whether aiadmk or DMK, are not giving adequate importance to the Nadars, Vannipeople and Devendra kula vellalar people.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is said that the party is upset with the Dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is the trick that the BJP has taken into its hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has decided to honour the respective community by giving a post to the people of the community, or to give importance.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Soundararajan as Thelgana Governor is the same.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be giving importance to the top nadars in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts as a respectfor every community, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, there is nothing masticating in any case that will make the BJP a party in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will be pouring more oil into the fire, as Tamil Nadu is already in the ruins of caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="21">If caste fire starts to burn, the fact is that even the bud of the lotus, which is now a little bit blooming in Tamil Nadu, will burn in the same fire!</seg>
