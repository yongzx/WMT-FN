<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is no mere compliment that Bhagat singh and his comrades have provided a new evolution and clear ideology to revolutionary movements and Indian politics through it.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see that there is a perception among people that revolutionaries are just fools and academics who don't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bhagat singh's period tells us their humanity and their clear thinking and ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bhagat singh's name was spread over india only after the legislative council bombing ceremony in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 1930, he made his public debut.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within one year of his debut, his reputation had spread rapidly even around all corners of tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most surprising news in history, including Gandhian, whose name no leader born in the north has spread in tamil Nadu in such a short time.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is because of the fatherhood they are.</seg>
<seg id="10">An editorial entitled Bhagat singh was published in the republic weekly relic of the murder of Bhagat singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat singh's character interests and offered some ideas about the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the categories from the book are: -</seg>
<seg id="13">'if Bhagat singh was genuinely convinced that all his policies were correct and that the models he had acted upon were the right religion and that he had decided to do so, we would have to say that if he had not walked away, he would not have been a yogic man.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, we shall call him a true man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that Bhagat singh ’ s policy is to india.</seg>
<seg id="16">If mr Bhagat singh had not been executed and lived, there would have been no evidence to be accepted by such a popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">And if Bhagat singh had not been executed, we would have said that Mahatma Gandhi would have been made to die.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why Bhagat singh's life was more useful for showing the people of the world a true path of equality and tranquillity to the people of india, where he must die with a disease or disease.</seg>

<seg id="13">This was followed by a steady flow of big employers to open up educational institutions to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a statement issued by the party's treasurer Duraimurugan, the chief minister criticised the intelligence of any detail about the public service.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his statement, DMK treasurer Duraimurugan said that the water that is opened in the seashore is in vain due to the unconcern of the ADMK government and lack of administrative capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the way Cauvery passed away, our leader MK Stalin expressed his concern for the responsibility of the opposition leader of the tamil Nadu legislature, saying that the ADMK government had no concrete plan to detain it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thinking that the response to the chief minister was to answer, Edappadi Palaniswami said, 'did the DMK blame us, in their rule, have they built a barrier on the side?'</seg>
<seg id="6">"I would like to tell him that we have built a barrier under the rule of the DMK in the direction of mayanur.</seg>
<seg id="7">Will chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who is also in charge of the public works department, speak out without the truth?</seg>
<seg id="8">With that barrier built in mayanur, earth's water resources grew in the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why agriculture flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's why thousands of people in the area who are benefitting from this day can be seen thanking the government of the club for their gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="11">The block was built by the government of the club in mayanur as required during that period.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, there was no need for further detentions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Had it been necessary, the artist, who was then chief minister, would have immediately given permission, set aside funds and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, there is no stone left for the government to blame the club for the welfare of the cautionary tale.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask, how many blocks have you built in the past eight years of the ADMK regime?</seg>
<seg id="16">We have built more than 40 dams in tamil Nadu during DMK regimes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to a single dam, a dam built in the A.D. regimes?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">Let us know with the evidence that if the leader of the opposition is responding to their allegation - we are building a barrier or planning to build in the innings.</seg>
<seg id="20">I am obliged to point out that it is not a civilized act or a beauty to the position of the chief minister, who is acting as a personal weight, that speaking without fact is not a deterrent in the direction of the DMK regime. '</seg>

<seg id="1">Is the BJP taking over the politics of the Khaled caste in tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">In tamil Nadu, the BJP is supposed to finally take on the politics of race if engengango is unable to wreak havoc on tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first time modi was prime minister, he was in a position to see Tamarai in tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this, for the second time, it was only after the election of the mp that Amitabh was condemned for saying, "i don't know what to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in the five volumes, only the soil was able to be absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is a wave of protests in tamil Nadu, even though the country is full of Bajwa.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all the case of triple talaq, Kashmir, the imposition of hindi, the same nation is the same language.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since all this has been done together, it is still found in the sundown.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership has been tough on BJP executives in tamil Nadu, and that is why even the state leadership has been so complex that it is yet to be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even if this is on the one hand, the BJP is planning to somehow root out the BJP in tamil Nadu within the upcoming assembly polls.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that reason, the BJP leadership seems to have almost come to an end through direct field ripper and intelligence ripper like this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, whether it is the agency or the Tithi, the idea that the two Dravidian parties are not sufficiently important to the people of nadar, the people of the vanniar community and the people of Devendra kulavarkar.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is also said to be sad for the Dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is this formula that the BJP has started trickling in and out.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to make their respective communities proud, or to give them a post of significance, it is decided to honour them.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of tamil Isai Soundararajan as governor of Telangana is such a one.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is also said to have placed emphasis on high ranking countries in isro.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts so as to honour each race, it will bring pride and joy to the respective ethnic people.</seg>
<seg id="19">And, in any case, the masiad will do massive to the BJP in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, it is not known if these activities of the BJP will further fuel the burning fire, when tamil Nadu is already becoming Chinna in caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="21">If such a caste fire starts burning, it is true that even Tamara's bald patch, which has blossomed in tamil Nadu, will be caught in the same fire!</seg>
