<seg id="1">There are revolution movements before and after Lord Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is not just praise that Bhagat Singh and his colleagues have given a new dimension and clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can see today that there is a perception among people that the revolutionaries are just fools, and that they are stonewallers who don't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The era of Bhagat Singh shows us their humanity, clear thinking and ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only after the April 1929 assembly bombing event did the Bhagat Singh name become widespread in India.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was only in the 1930s that it became known to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his fame had spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most surprising news in history, the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is the reason why they are the father.</seg>
<seg id="10">The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial entitled Bhagat Singh was published in Republic Weekly.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and offered some views on the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some sections from that editorial:</seg>
<seg id="13">"In fact, we will say that if Bhagat Singh Ji is satisfied with the whole of his policies and the models he has behaved in order to fulfil it are the right way and if he has decided to do so, he should definitely behave as he has behaved and if he has not behaved in that way, he cannot be a youthful man.</seg>
<seg id="14">So now we will say he is a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that India needs a Bhagat Singh policy indeed.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been executed and died, there would have been no evidence of this success being caused by such popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Let's say that Gandhi would still have been constructive if he had not hanged Lord Singh.</seg>
<seg id="18">For Bhagat Singh, who should have died of an illness or disease, why did the mother who could use her life to show the people of India the path of true equality and Shanti to the people of the world?</seg>
<seg id="19">We congratulate Bhagat Singh for his heartfelt, vocal and handling, saying that it is a gift that no one else can achieve by normal. "</seg>

<seg id="13">This was followed by a continuous flow of large employers to start educational institutions so as to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this context, the new education policy has imposed various rules requiring educational institutions to operate under the funding of private institutions, without giving any importance to government education institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through this, the central government has pushed for only the privileged to study from basic education to higher education and is working to bring India's prosperous future back to centuries of illiteracy.</seg>

<seg id="7">Ranu has produced a lot of students through the Khartoum Research and Education Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In general, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by family.</seg>

<seg id="1">The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy how many barriers were built during the last eight years of AIADMK rule.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement regarding this, the party's treasurer Duraimurugan criticised the chief minister for spying without knowing any details about the public works department.</seg>
<seg id="3">DMK Treasurer Duraimurugan said in his statement that the water opened in the cavity is wasted in the sea due to the indifference of the ADMK government - and a lack of administrative capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our president M.K. Stalin has expressed his concern in his responsibility as the leader of the opposition in the Tamil Nadu assembly, that the A.D.M. government has no concrete plan to stop it on the way past Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Considering that he was responding to the chief minister, Edappadi Palanisamy said: "Have the DMK, who criticise us, built a barrier in the cavern in their government?"</seg>
<seg id="6">"I want to convey to him, we have built a barrier under the DMK rule at Mayanur in Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without even knowing the details, can Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who also holds the public works department in his charge, speak untruthfully?</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to that barrier built in Mayanur, the Earth's water resources in that area increased.</seg>
<seg id="9">So farming flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">So today and usefully, thousands of people from the regional agricultural giants can be seen thanking the League government and rejoicing any day.</seg>
<seg id="11">As per the requirements of that phase, a barrier was built by the club government in Mayanur.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, there was no need to build more barriers.</seg>
<seg id="13">If there was a need, the artist who was then the chief minister would have given permission immediately, allocated funds and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hence, there is no reason for Edappadi to criticise the club government in the maintenance of the caution.</seg>
<seg id="15">I am asking: How many barriers have you built in the cafe in the past eight years of A.D.M. rule?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question: During the DMK tenure, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to at least one dam that has been built in the A.D.M. regimes so far?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don't speak lies.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the leader of the opposition responds to their accusation - tell the source that we are building a barrier or are planning to build in inner-city places.</seg>
<seg id="20">Leaving it at that, to speak untruthfully that the barrier was not built in the cavalry under the DMK rule, it would be beautiful if it were for a personal edge, for the post of chief minister which he holds, I am obliged to point out that it is not a civilised act but a beautiful one, "Duraimurugan said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is the BJP taking over caste politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Anyway, in Tamil Nadu, if Suthi is unable to make Thamarai blossom, the BJP is supposed to eventually take over caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first time Modi was prime minister, he had to abandon Thamarai in Tamil Nadu and watch it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this, for the second time, only during the MPP elections that were held, Amit Shah strictly said: "You don't know what to do. In Tamil Nadu, Tamar should be flowered."</seg>
<seg id="5">But in the five constituencies contested, only the soil could be found.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though the entire country has been mesmerised by the BJP, there has been a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all Triple Talaq, the issue of Kashmir, the imposition of Hindi, and the same nation is one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since this all came together, it is still seen in the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is reportedly in a tough spot on the Tamil Nadu BJP executives, which is why it is so complicated that even the state leadership cannot be nominated yet.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite this, the BJP is making plans to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu sometime within the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that, it seems the BJP leadership has come to a virtual conclusion through live field reporting and intelligence reporting.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of their respective communities that whether it is the AIADMK or the DMK, the 2 Dravida parties do not give enough importance to the people of Nadar, the people of Vanniyar and the people of Devendra Kula farmer.</seg>
<seg id="13">So it is said that the Dravida parties are in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is the fix the BJP has started to implement with a tactical hand.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is said that they have decided to honour their respective communities with a post that glorifies or gives importance to them.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Tamil Nadu Soundararajan as the Governor of Telangana is one such thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is also reportedly giving importance to the high ranking Nadals in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in honour of each race, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of their respective communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, something that is not masculine in any case will give the BJP a foothold in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already immersed in caste politics, it is not clear if these actions of the BJP will pour more oil on the flames.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if the caste fires start burning, even the balm of Tamarai, which is now a bit of a flower in Tamil Nadu, will catch on the same fire!</seg>
