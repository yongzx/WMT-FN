<seg id="1">There are still revolutionary movements ahead of Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But the fact that Bhagat Singh and his friends have offered revolutionary movements and thus a new evolution for Indian politics and a clear ideology is not a mere consolation.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see that the revolutionaries are mere mendicks, and that there is a consensus among the public that they are unconcerned about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The period of Bhagat Singh has taught us their humanity and ingenuity.</seg>

<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of the cultural advantages of Bhagat Singh and offered some ideas about the political climate of the day.</seg>

<seg id="13">"in fact, we should have learned from Bhagat Singh that his policies are all that is right, and that the models that he has adopted will not have worked if he had not decided that he is the right course.</seg>
<seg id="14">So let us now tell him that we are a true human being.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our strong view is that Bhagat Singh's policy toward India is, indeed, the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Mr. Bharat Singh had not been executed and died, there would have been no evidence that this achievement would have been so popular.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, if Bhagat's Singh had not been executed, we would have said that Gandhian would still have made sense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why did the film give the people of Bhagwati the real equality and peace that he sought to bring to the Indian people, who had to die from the disease and die from it?</seg>

<seg id="1">The last eight years have raised questions for Prime Minister Edupadi Pazizi about how many of the barriers built during the AKP's reign will be.</seg>
<seg id="2">In this regard, Muraian, the party's adviser, has criticized the chief minister for being ignorant of any aspect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the governor of Dwight Murugan put it in his report, the water that is being opened in the camel's back is being wasted by the lack of attention and management capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our leader, M.K. Stalin, expressed his concern that the government would not have a coherent plan for the future, and that the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council would be spared.</seg>
<seg id="5">In response to the chief of staff, Epapadi Picasamy has asked, "Do we blame ourselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">"I want to tell him that, in the case of the D.W. Bush regime, we have built a wall in Kavanar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without that knowledge, will the public sector be able to speak for itself and the chief minister, Eduardo Padang, who has been in charge?</seg>
<seg id="8">With that wall built in vanity, the earth's resources multiplied in that area.</seg>
<seg id="9">So the bubble burst.</seg>
<seg id="10">That is why, even today, the region's agricultural giant, thousands of people, can still be said to be grateful to the state of the church.</seg>
<seg id="11">The time was ripe for such a move in the direction of the Ottoman Empire.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, there was no need for further liquidity injections.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once the need had been turned on, they would have been the chief minister of the time, immediately giving him permission to cut off the funds, and pushing the job forward.</seg>
<seg id="14">So there is no story that can be boiled down to claims of the church's health.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask: how many of the checks and balances you have built in the last eight years of the D.D. rule in Kevin, Virginia?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question is this: have we built more than 40 of the MDCs in times of authoritarian rule in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="17">So far, can you point to a single dam built among the TPP regimes?</seg>
<seg id="18">False silence.</seg>
<seg id="19">Consider the case of the opposition leader who said that we are blocking or planning to build walls in the areas where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="20">I would have been glad to hear Trump say that Trump has not built the wall in the D.com regime, and that he is not, to put it mildly, a favorite candidate for the position of Chief Minister. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Does the BoJ have a grip on Chinese politics in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">After all, whatever happens in Nadu, when there is no clean water, it is assumed that the jihadist politics will eventually take hold.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was Prime Minister for the first time, he was seen as having failed to break the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="4">After that, the second time was when the MBA election ended, Akihito famously said that "no one knows what to do, and no one knows what to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet there are five competing scenarios that could lead to the end of the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the country is wringing its feet, the tide of anti-Thaksin rage is running out of steam.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is all the more true in the case of Trump, the Kashmir affair, the imposition of Hindi terrorism, and a single country.</seg>
<seg id="8">Once all of this is done, the burden of adjustment will be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why it is said that the leadership of the BJP is in disarray, and why it is so difficult to take over the state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is one side of the story, and BJP's plan is to root out Ba'athism in the upcoming legislative election.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that, it seems that the BJP has come to a near-definitive conclusion through direct tax breaks and intelligence services.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if that were the case, it would still be difficult for the public to understand why it is so important for the people of Najib and the people of Vegregon to have access to it.</seg>
<seg id="13">So it is said that the renminbi is in deficit.</seg>
<seg id="14">The BoJ has begun to impose this burden on its own hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">That society is supposed to be proud of, or give priority to, that person a position.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soros's appointment as governor of Telangana is just such a thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government has placed a high priority on the Yar'Adua in ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a way as to make each of these people feel proud and happy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, in any case, a Machiavellian state would give Ba'ath a foothold in caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, it is hard to see whether the actions of Ba'athist are like adding more fuel to the fire when the caste politics are already in tatters.</seg>
<seg id="21">If such caste fires start to soar, the reality is that even a small fraction of the coral that is now bleeding in Tamil Nadu will be washed away in the same fire.</seg>
