<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, the fact that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and clear ideology to revolutionary movements and to the Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see a perception among the people that revolutionaries are just fools and ignorant of human life.</seg>
<seg id="4">The period of Bhagat Singh gives us their humanitarianism, their thinking and their ability.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the April 1929 bombing, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.</seg>

<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his popularity has spread rapidly even in all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>

<seg id="1">The DMK has questioned Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy as to how many of the barricades built during the AIADMK regime for the past 8 years.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement issued by the party's treasurer Duraimurugan, the chief minister has criticized the public works department for not knowing any details.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his statement, DMK Treasurer Duraimurugan said that the water being opened in Kaveri is mixing in the sea in vain due to the disinterest of the government - and the lack of administrative capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the way to Cauvery, our leader M. K. Stalin expressed his concern over the responsibility of being the Leader of the Opposition of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, saying that the government had no plans to detain it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Edapadi Palanisamy, who spoke in response to the Chief Minister, said, "Do you blame us?</seg>
<seg id="6">"what I want to say to him is that in the rule of the DMK, we have blocked the Kamayanur rule in Kaveri.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without even knowing that, Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who is in charge of the Public Works Department, can speak without truth?</seg>
<seg id="8">The barrier built at Mayanur increased the earth's water level.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so agriculture flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">So thousands of people from the area who are still benefiting today, thank the government of the club for all the day.</seg>
<seg id="11">As required by the time, the barrier was built by the government of Mayanur.</seg>
<seg id="12">At that time, there was no need to build more barricades.</seg>
<seg id="13">If there was a need, the then Chief Minister, the artist would have given permission for it, allocated funds and stepped up the work</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, it is nowhere near to blame the corporation for the welfare of the Kaveri.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask; How many barricades have you built in Kaveri in the last eight years of the rule of thumb?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question; We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK rule.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to at least one dam, the dam built by the successive regimes?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the opposition leader's allegations are in response to their allegations, we are building or planning to build in the places where there is a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="20">Leaving it, I am obliged to point out that it is not a civilized act or beauty for the Chief Minister of the country to talk about the fact that the Cauvery barrier is not built in the rule of the government. "</seg>

<seg id="7">This is above all the Muthalak, the Kashmir affair, the imposition of Hindi, one nation onelanguage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because everything is together, it is still in delay.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is reportedly in trouble with the BJP's chief executive, which has caused so much trouble that even the state leadership cannot be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the one hand, the BJP is planning to somehow root the BJP in Tamil Nadu within the upcoming legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BJP leadership seems to have come to an end with a direct field report, intelligence report.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, whether it is AIADMK or DMK, the idea that the 2 Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the Nadar people and the people of the Vanniyar community.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is also said that the Dravidian parties are upset.</seg>
<seg id="14">The BJP has begun to take this tactic into its hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has decided to honor or honor the respective social communities with an emphasis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Telangana Governor, Tamil Nadu Soundararajan's appointment is something like that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be of importance to high-ranking countries in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a way as to honor every race, the people of the respective race will be proud and happy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, in any case, the BJP will not tolerate this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already mired in caste politics, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will become more like pouring oil on the burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn, even the bald of the lotus, which is now a little bit of a famine in Tamil Nadu, will be burned in the same fire!</seg>
