<seg id="4">The police have arrested only a few people.</seg>
<seg id="5">A protest against the incident was announced on the 9th of last month on behalf of the secular Progressive Alliance parties in Tiruppur amid strong condemnation from industry, various political parties, movements and the general public.</seg>
<seg id="6">When permission was refused, a complaint was filed with the district collector and Tiruppur Metropolitan Police Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="7">At a subsequent consultation meeting, a demonstration was announced again on September 17 on behalf of the secular Progressive Alliance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the police refused permission for the demonstration as well, a protest demonstration started at 11 am on the 17th of last month in front of Tiruppur Municipal Corporation "condemning the violent tendencies of the Hindu Front - and urging the police to take swift action."</seg>
<seg id="9">The demonstration was led by DMK secretary K Selvaraj of the northern district of Tiruppur.</seg>

<seg id="12">The secular Progressive Alliance said at the time; on 5 May in Tiruppur, an organisation called the Hindu Front attacked a backpacker company and rioted.</seg>
<seg id="13">We formally asked permission for a democratic demonstration to protest the incident, the police did not give permission, we filed a complaint with the ruler and the police commissioner about it, and since the police refused permission for the demonstration after that, a democratically charitable demonstration is now taking place in defiance of the ban.</seg>
<seg id="14">Police have also arrested only a handful of people in the attack on the backpacker company.</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, they said the police should take swift action in arresting leading Hindu gangsters involved in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">Large numbers of more than 500 people, especially women, took part in the demonstration and spoke out against the violence, prompting police to back away from arresting the protesters.</seg>
<seg id="17">The demonstration strongly condemned the attack on a backpacker company in Tiruppur by the Hindu Front and the religious-violence being perpetrated by the Hindu Front in various forms.</seg>

<seg id="2">While many people have complained about it, they don't seem to realise that they are thinking of an alternative, or that the solution lies with them.</seg>

<seg id="9">In the meantime, Tamang is contesting assembly by-elections in Sikkim.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tamang is governing in Sikkim with the support of the BJP.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is no mere compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have provided a new paradigm and clear ideology to revolutionary movements and thus Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">We can still see that there is a perception among people that revolutionaries are just fools and stone-throwers who don't care about human lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bhagat Singh period gives us a sense of their humanity and clear thinking and skill.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was only after the April 1929 legislative bombing that Bhagat Singh's name became widely known in India.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little further away in Tamil Nadu, he made his public debut in 1930.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of his debut, his fame had spread rapidly, even to all corners of Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the most amazing news in history, the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi, has never spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short period of time.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was because of Father Periyar.</seg>
<seg id="10">The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in the Republic Weekly headlined Bhagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and made some points about the political situation of the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">A few excerpts from the headline:</seg>
<seg id="13">"In fact," he said, "if Bhagat Singh had made a heartfelt determination that all his principles were right and decided that the models he behaved in order to carry it out were the right religion and if he had decided that he must have behaved as he did, we would say that if he had not behaved as he did, he would not have been able to say that he was a yogi man.</seg>
<seg id="14">So now we will call him a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that the Bhagat Singh policy is what India really needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been executed and died, there would have been no evidence that this victory was caused by such popularity.</seg>
<seg id="17">And let us say that if Bhagat Singh had not been executed, Gandhianism would still have been made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why did Bhagat Singh, who should have been suffering and dying of illness on his own, have to give up his life as a mother who could be used to show the people of India the path of true equality and peace for the people of the world?</seg>
<seg id="19">We heartily, vociferously and handily applaud Bhagat Singh, saying it is a great privilege that no one else can achieve by ordinary people!'</seg>

<seg id="2">Consultations and recommendations have been made to resolve pay disputes in the service of teachers and principals, the education ministry said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Ministry of Education said it was a grossly unjust act for teachers and principals based on their pay dispute not to attend the service on sick leave as the recommendation of the committee to remove the public services pay discrepancy to increase the salaries of all government employees, including teachers and principals, was ready to be implemented from 1 January next year.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the right of employees to engage in trade union activities.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has not been challenged but the ministry has said that cheating on the opportunistic activities of unions, which are used as a strategy to deceive members by pointing to their action as a success even after learning of the potential pay increase, is not an acceptable activity for an intelligent and honourable profession such as teaching principals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Education Minister Lawyer Akhilviraj Kariyawasam told parliament last July that there had been a massive increase in the salaries of teachers and principals in line with 2015 and that the amount had been increased by 106 percent, as well as an increase in salaries.</seg>

<seg id="11">The ministry is also said to have instructed their respective companies to carry out development work based on the amount from construction work that can be done by their respective technical educational institutions and to borrow from the bank and receive the amount from corporations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since coming to power, the BJP has been preventing education from reaching the common man as much as possible, cutting funding for primary education in the 2015 budget and subsequently drastically reducing funding for education during every budget.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was followed by a series of overtures by big business to start educational institutions in order to provide more facilities for private educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this context, the government has imposed a series of regulations so that educational institutions are funded by private institutions without giving any prominence to state educational institutions in the new education policy.</seg>
<seg id="15">With this, the central government is working to push only the affluent from basic education to higher education and take India's prosperous future back centuries as an illiterate country.</seg>

<seg id="8">Generally, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by his or her family.</seg>

<seg id="1">The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami how many barricades were built during the last eight years of AIADMK rule.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement, the party's treasurer Durai Murugan criticised the Chief Minister for spying on the public works department without knowing any details.</seg>
<seg id="3">DMK treasurer Durai Murugan said in a statement that the water that opens up in the Cauvery flows wastefully into the sea due to the indifference of the ADMK government - and lack of administrative competence.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the way across the Cauvery, our leader MK Stalin had expressed his concern in his responsibility as Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly that the ADMK government had no concrete plan to stop and store it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thinking he was responding to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palanisamy has asked: "Did the DMK, who blame us, build at least one barracks in the Cauvery under their rule?"</seg>
<seg id="6">"What I want to tell him is that under the DMK regime we have built a barrage at Mayanur in Cauvery under the League regime," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without even knowing that detail, could Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy, who also has the Public Works Department in his charge, speak untruthfully?</seg>
<seg id="8">The barrier, built in Mayanur, increased the earth's water resources in the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">So agriculture flourished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of the agricultural giants of that region, who still benefit from it today, will find themselves forever grateful to the League government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The barracks were built by the League government in Mayanur as required at that time.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, there was no need to build any more barriers.</seg>
<seg id="13">If there had been a need, the artist, then the chief minister, would have immediately sanctioned it, funded it and stepped up the work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, Edappadi is no closer to blaming the League government for the well-being of the Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ask; how many barricades have you built in the Cauvery in the last eight years when the ADMK is in power?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question; we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you point to at least one dam, a dam built in the ADMK regimes so far?</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">If there is an answer to the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition - tell us with evidence that we are building or planning to build a barrier in other places.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead of that, I am obliged to point out that speaking untruthfully that the barricade itself was not built in the Cauvery under the DMK regime may be a thing of beauty for a personal Edappadi, but for the post of chief minister he holds, it is neither a civilised act nor a thing of beauty," Durai Murugan said.</seg>

<seg id="4">On the orders of Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy, six committees have been set up to investigate the President's actions.</seg>

<seg id="6">Scientific dating excavations at the bottom have concluded that the time of Tamil-Brahmi is another 100 years old, showing that Tamil Nadu was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, samples from 70 skeletons uncovered by the study have been sent to Deccan College, a postgraduate and research institute, for scientific analysis.</seg>
<seg id="8">The erectile dysfunction was classified according to character in the analysis, identifying creatures such as timilkala, fox, goat, wild boar, arthropod and peacock with erectile dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="9">The study also hinges on the fact that animals such as cows, ducks and goats are used for agriculture and for food as cuticles are found in some rising samples in animals such as arthropods, bats and wild boar.</seg>
<seg id="10">Through the conclusion of this analysis, those whose society was primarily about agriculture also took up animal husbandry.</seg>
<seg id="11">Samples of roof tiles depending on bricks and limestone and the coating of a textile made of firewood have been sent to Vellore Technical University for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In each of these, minerals such as silicon, limestone, iron, aluminum and magnesium can be found in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is the BJP taking on caste politics to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Somehow in Tamil Nadu, if you can't clean up somewhere and let the tamarind bloom, the BJP is said to be finally taking on caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">When Modi was prime minister for the first time, he had to abandon the tamarind in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the second time since then, i.e. during the ongoing MP elections, Amit Shah has sternly said, "I don't know what you will do, the tamarind should bloom in Tamil Nadu."</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was only in the five contested seats that it was able to bite the dust.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite lashing out at the BJP across the country, there has been a wave of protests in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is above all the triple talaq, the Kashmir issue, the imposition of Hindi, one nation, one language.</seg>
<seg id="8">With all this coming together, it's still in a state of flux.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why the BJP leadership is said to be furious with Tamil Nadu BJP executives, which is why it is still so difficult to even appoint the state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite this, the BJP is planning to somehow root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the upcoming assembly elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that reason, the BJP leadership seems to have come to an almost certain conclusion through direct field reporting and intelligence reporting.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of their respective communities that neither the AIADMK nor the DMK nor the 2 Dravidian parties attach enough importance to the Nadar people, the Vanni people and the Devendra clan.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is also said to be upset with the Dravidian parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is the formula that the BJP has manipulated and begun to implement.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has decided to honour the respective community with a position of pride, or importance.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Tamilisai Soundararajan as governor of Telangana is one such thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, the BJP government is said to be giving prominence to high-ranking Nadars in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that if the BJP acts in such a way that every race is honoured, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of their respective races.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, something that is not masochistic in any case will be masochistic for the BJP in this caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, when Tamil Nadu is already being torn apart in caste politics, it is not clear whether these actions by the BJP will be like pouring more oil on a burning fire.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fact is that if such a caste fire starts to ignite, even the mould of the tamarind that has now bloomed a little in Tamil Nadu will be engulfed in the same fire!</seg>
