<seg id="1">TikTok hides inappropriate videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Documents obtained from the publication reveal that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is using the app to promote the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bulk of violations related to China's policy fall under "hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok puts undesirable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not appear censored.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the document.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prohibited material falls into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may result in the blocking of the user.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives for ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as bringing in independent local experts."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producers Centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Producers Centre is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without approval, reports Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="18">Asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov replies affirmatively and says he has seen similar publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">The founder of the agency Our Didgital, Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can’t post shocking content that discriminates against statements, and so on”.</seg>
<seg id="20">But any content that moderators do not like can be summed up under these rules, Zaripov notes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Administrators of the social network check their age using artificial intelligence: the neuronet analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.</seg>

<seg id="4">The case almost went to trial, but the Catalans suggested that the player resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Otherwise, they refuse him a return.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, had an interesting focus: under an agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, just a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Neymar's claims came to light in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Blue granite" insists that the bonus relied on the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, the club believe that the player was paid only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand a refund of the proportional part of the first payment.</seg>

<seg id="3">Evidence of the very fact of "mass disorder" does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">The collapse of the case should embolden the public, but it is certain to leave the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved futile, in extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder) - Aleksei Minaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after several hours he was completely rehabilitated: the Investigative Committee dropped the charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Minailo sat under arrest for almost two months, and several professional communities joined him at once: historians, priests, and writers.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, only two people accused of participating in the riots remained in the case (there were 13 initially accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radzhabov, whom the court extended his arrest to the end of December the day before (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the government, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On Police" in order to protect law enforcement officers from the spread of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts; the draft document itself has not yet been published.</seg>
<seg id="4">The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of defamatory information, including discrediting information."</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly how police officers are supposed to be protected from online defamation is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, in the explanation to the document, it is noted that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by individualizing the mechanism”, already predetermined by the law on blocking posts that offend representatives of the government, and by the law on fines for such posts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both laws came into force in March of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and an independent anti-corruption review.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the explanatory note, amendments to the law "On Police" are due to take effect in January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "blatant disrespect of the state" on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the first violation of the bans, a fine in the amount of 30 to 300 thousand roubles is provided, and for the second violation, an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">On April 12, Roskomnadzor applied this norm for the first time in relation to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon after, the Chudovsky District Court of Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting on the network "two records with information in an indecent form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, and bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation."</seg>

<seg id="3">The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's another matter how timely its introduction is in our country.</seg>

<seg id="7">This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system regulating its legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything in order that the size of pensions and the social security of citizens improve.</seg>

<seg id="4">One of the comic book's most celebrated heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel film universe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate the rights to use it in franchise films.</seg>
<seg id="6">This became known from a Sony press release, which says that the third installment of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, which would leave the Marvel film universe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sony owns the rights to the film character.</seg>
<seg id="9">She leased them for the Marvel films, which are owned by Disney.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, Sony earned revenue from the box office and Disney from souvenirs and toys.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was reported that at some point Disney was no longer happy with this arrangement, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was delighted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shockingly, Spidey [Spider-Man]'s journey into the Marvel film universe will continue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Spider-Man is an iconic figure.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world," he said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It just so happened that he's the only super-powered hero to find himself in different places.</seg>
<seg id="19">So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may offer unexpected surprises," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted an excerpt from the film "The Wolf of Wall Street" on his Instagram account, in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Information about contradictions between the companies emerged in August.</seg>
<seg id="22">Disney wanted half of the box office revenue from the Spider-Man films on the condition that both companies pay half of the costs of producing the films, media reported.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Sony didn't like it.</seg>
<seg id="24">News of the beloved superhero's possible departure from the Marvel film universe has angered many loyal fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Details of the new terms have not yet been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sony declined to comment on the agreement, CNBC reports, but said: "We've collaborated beautifully over the past four years and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Regions were invited to share business support secrets</seg>
<seg id="2">As it became known to Parlamentskaya Gazeta, on September 27, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maksim Oreshkin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the area of support of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">It's time to establish interregional ties</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized information received from the regions about existing business development and legalization programs for the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent proposals to improve existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Currently, communication between the regions is insufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators identified the issue of the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country", Andrei Kutepov stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an appendix to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with suggestions and problems (available at the disposal of the editorial board).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step toward such an exchange will be the direction of information available to the Economic Policy Committee," the senator told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating in many regions of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, in Vologda region, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">A business support system has been developed in Ivanovo region, providing for the implementation of the principle of a single window through multifunctional centres.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Krasnodar Krai, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a cluster development centre in Oryol region.</seg>
<seg id="17">Amur region, within the framework of the federal project "The acceleration of small and medium-sized businesses", provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers, at the expense of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="19">The self-employed continue to be led out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to regional authorities, in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively, a number of changes to existing legislation should be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," since this "is most consistent with the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="22">In Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to introduce amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential buildings, holiday homes, and the conduct of physical training classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers using the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in Kostroma and Magadan regions, they are advocating the consolidation of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship in the regulatory and legal field.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will receive development in the form of specific bills.</seg>

<seg id="2">Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on a plane, you can now find out where young children will sit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, if you want a neighborhood with them, you can avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers of Japan Airlines (JAL) were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.</seg>
<seg id="5">The carrier has launched a feature that allows you to track where children will sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">When choosing seats in the cabin during ticket booking, passengers will be able to see an image of a child's head on the ground, which is occupied by children aged between eight days and two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying, can get as far away from them as possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted by the innovation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">One user complained that a few weeks ago he was on a flight from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting next door to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commentator suggested introducing "adult-only flights," expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many tourists noted that now they will always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, because they do not see anything pleasant about flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, a woman traveling with a baby tried to appease fellow passengers on a Seoul-San Francisco flight.</seg>
<seg id="14">She prepared bags of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with a note of apology.</seg>

<seg id="2">Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the series of single pickets "Freedom for All", which take place on Friday outside the Presidential Administration building on Staraya Square in Moscow, reports a correspondent for Interfax.</seg>
<seg id="3">A series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently, the participants of the action, replacing each other, stand holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom for all" and the surnames of the convicted and arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition to Ustinov, the poster bears the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Aleksey Minyailo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.</seg>
<seg id="6">On September 16, the Tverskoy Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general regime penal colony on charges of using violence against a member of the OMON of the Russian Guards at an uncoordinated action on August 3 in the center of Moscow (Part 2 of Article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).</seg>

<seg id="1">Deliveries of "sanctions" to Russia have fallen 100-fold</seg>
<seg id="2">The Government of the Russian Federation has calculated that the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the cost of imported goods decreased to 226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the report points out, the dropped volumes of prohibited goods were offset by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">To recall, at the end of August, the government extended until 31 December 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials, and foodstuffs, which are prohibited from entering Russia as part of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity period of the rules has been extended for another year - from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the sanctions removal order applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway, and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, starting on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein "joined" this list, and starting on 1 January 2016 Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of “sanctions” illegally imported into the country (products subject to a food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to anti-Russian Western sanctions) came into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" foodstuffs by any legal means.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its retaliatory measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of foodstuffs “simply immoral”, and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, at the beginning of June, Rospotrebnadzor came up with an initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation made a similar recommendation to the government.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Aleksei Gordeev stated that it is wrong to destroy foodstuffs, and it is necessary to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.</seg>

<seg id="2">TASS reports this with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).</seg>
<seg id="3">Construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) will be located, has officially begun this week, ESO reports, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.</seg>
<seg id="6">The telescope's most expensive and complex component is its record-breakingly large mirror, which will have a diameter of around 39 metres.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's twins.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the neighborhood of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was around 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.</seg>
