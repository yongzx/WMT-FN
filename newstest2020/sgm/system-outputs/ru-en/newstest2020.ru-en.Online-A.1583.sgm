<seg id="1">TikTok hides undesirable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents, which caught up with the publication, show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under the "incitement of hatred."</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places inappropriate posts in a context that fits the general rules so that the social network doesn't look censored.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticizing China's socialist system falls under a blanket ban on "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Posts from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and can lead to a user's blocking.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to algorithms TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local experts."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producing Center.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Producing Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of bloggers "Producing Center" agree with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Asked if TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">The founder of our Didgital agency Roman Saripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content that discriminates and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules, you can sum up any content that moderators don't like, notes saripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">The agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">Under the user agreement, only people over the age of 13 can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes the faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of Coworking WeWork.</seg>

<seg id="4">The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Otherwise, they refuse to return him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neymar and his dodgy father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, just a year later the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Blues insist that the bonus was due to run the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, the club considers that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand the return of the proportional part of the first payment.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player to the bosom of Catalonia.</seg>
<seg id="14">True, the deal fell through, but the hope for a reverse transition forward remains.</seg>
<seg id="15">And so, as Sports reports. Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in the pre-trial order, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.</seg>

<seg id="2">Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the country fully earned a bill on a guaranteed pension product.</seg>
<seg id="3">The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another matter how timely its introduction is with us.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," Matviyenko said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the speaker, Russians cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, as "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".</seg>
<seg id="7">This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions and social security of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="9">But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities," Matviyenko told RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on the guaranteed pension product) will develop, then there should be several basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of pension savings.</seg>
<seg id="11">On September 6, the Ministry of Finance announced the submission of a bill on the Guaranteed Pension Product (GPP) for approval.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of joining citizens to the system of savings, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their existing business development programs and the legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the senators' visitation was not identified the issue of lack of information about regional programs of entrepreneurship development in the country as a whole," Andrei Kutepov said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and aggregated data from regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sharing information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step to such an exchange will be the direction of information available to the Economic Policy Committee," the senator told the Parliamentary newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, in many regions of the country adopted and successfully operate programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, the Vologda region has a Business Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">A business support system has been developed in the Ivanovo region, which involves the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Krasnodar region, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">The center of cluster development operates in the Orlov region.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Amur region, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators based on existing non-state co-working centers, at the expense of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions special measures of support for youth entrepreneurship are being taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">The self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the regional authorities, a number of changes in the current legislation should be made in order to better support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk Region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity" because it was "most consistent with the content of public services to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities on finishing and repairing living quarters, cottage buildings, conducting physical training classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in the Kostrom and Magadan regions they call for the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship to be enshrined in the legal and legal field.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of concrete bills," Andrei Kutepov said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government has estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>

<seg id="5">These are the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the report, the volumes of prohibited products were compensated by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the end of August, the government extended to December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules of destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the rules were extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the order on the destruction of the sanction applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="17">Moreover, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation made a similar recommendation to the government.</seg>
