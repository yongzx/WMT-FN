<seg id="1">TikTok hides unwanted videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China/Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">Documents leaked to the publication reveal that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations relating to China's policies fall under "hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context that fits the general rules, so that the social network's actions do not appear to be censored.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticizing China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incidents or the genocide in Cambodia falls under "distortion of the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document states.</seg>
<seg id="11">The banned material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and may result in the blocking of the user.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as engaging independent local experts."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says co-founder of the "Production Center" Rustem Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All promotional materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, reports Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked if TikTok can speak out about politics or Putin, Bogdanov says yes and says he has seen such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But any content that moderators don't like can be brought under these rules, Zaripov said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">Under the user agreement, only people over the age of 13 can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the co-working company WeWork.</seg>

<seg id="7">However, just a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record €222 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not only that, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.</seg>

<seg id="11">The Blue-Pomegranates insist that the bonus was due for the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly, the club believe that the player was entitled to only a quarter of the 40 million euros and demand a refund of the proportional part of the first payment.</seg>

<seg id="4">One of the most famous comic book heroes, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the franchise's films.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was announced in a press release from Sony, which said that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, causing Spider-Man to leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sony owns the rights to the movie hero.</seg>
<seg id="9">She rented them out for Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, Sony earned revenue from box office receipts and Disney from souvenirs and toys.</seg>
<seg id="11">At one point, Disney reportedly stopped making such a provision, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was delighted.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's amazing that Spidey's [Spider-Man's] journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.</seg>

<seg id="16">This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world, "he said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It so happens that he is the only superpowered hero who has found himself in different cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="19">So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="21">Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from the Spider-Man films on the condition that both companies pay half of the cost of producing the films.</seg>
<seg id="23">But that didn't suit Sony.</seg>
<seg id="24">News of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has drawn the ire of many loyal fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Details of the new terms have not yet been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said, "We've been working well together for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.</seg>

<seg id="2">As it became known to "Parliamentary Newspaper," on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">It is time to establish interregional ties</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the programs of business development and legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit of senators has identified the issue of the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," Andrei Kutepov stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the appendix to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Economic Policy Committee, "the senator told the Parliamentary Newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, in the Vologda region there is an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Krasnodar Krai, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a cluster development center in the Oryol region.</seg>
<seg id="17">Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized businesses" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers at the expense of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions, special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," as it "most corresponds to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="22">In Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, cottage buildings, physical training classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the consolidation of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship in the legal framework.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>
<seg id="26">"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrei Kutepov assured.</seg>

<seg id="8">Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted with the innovation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deliveries of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government estimates that supplies of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo have decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are talking about the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the report, the volume of banned products was compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the rules have been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the order to destroy the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine "joined" this list.</seg>
<seg id="11">A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctions" (products subject to a food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions by the West) came into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its retaliatory measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food "simply immoral," and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, a similar recommendation was made to the government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food products, and it is necessary to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.</seg>
