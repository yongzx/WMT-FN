<seg id="1">TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years of age</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">The Chinese social network TikTok puts censorship of videos that mention Tiananmen Square, the independence of Tibet or the prohibited religious group Falun Gong, says The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents found in the edition tell that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) promotes the objectives of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bulk of China's policy violations are “inciting hatred”.</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places unpleasant publications in a context suitable for general rules to ensure that social network actions do not look censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the prohibition of the criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attack on policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">The prohibition of mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “examination of China’s history or other countries”.</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen”, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong-un, Indian policy Mahatm Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, President of Indonesia Joko Vidodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is stated in the document.</seg>
<seg id="11">The prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and can entail the user's blocking.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations include the second category: similar publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now for moderation we use a localized approach, as well as attract independent local specialists".</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, tells the co-founder of the "Food Center" Rustem Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Producer Center" - one Russian media company, which officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agree with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Asked whether in TikTok there is a policy or Putin, Bogdanov meets affirmatively and says that he saw such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Bogdanov agrees the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agency: "The main rules for TikTok users list in the user agreement: it is impossible to post shocking content that discriminate against statements and so on".</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules it is possible to bring any content that does not like moderators, notes Zaripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok under the user agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social network administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: neurosene analyzes faces and determines how many years the person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If nurse decides that the user is younger, his account can remove, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the cowing WeWork.</seg>

<seg id="5">On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Miniyailo was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligation, and a few more hours and rehabilitated at all: SKR removed charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Minibelo requested almost two months in detention, for him several professional communities came to him: historians, priests, writers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thereafter, only two accused were left to participate in the riots (originally accused were 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had extended the arrest until the end of December (it is also accused of violence against a representative of the authorities, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).</seg>

<seg id="3">The practice of increasing the pension through personal savings in the world is quite common.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another thing is how timely it is to introduce it.</seg>

<seg id="7">This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system regulating its legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to ensure that pensions, social security of citizens improve.</seg>
<seg id="9">But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," V. Matvienko said "RIA Novosti".</seg>
<seg id="10">The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on guaranteed pension products) develops, several basic principles, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the preservation of pension savings, should be provided.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on September 6 to send a bill on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).</seg>

<seg id="2">As the “Parliamentary Gazette” became known, on September 27, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreškin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express the position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve the legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">It is time to establish interregional ties</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from regions on their business development and legalization programmes, as well as on the results of such programmes.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions spoke to the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"To date, communication between the regions is not enough, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit has identified the issue of lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in general in the country," Andrei Kutepov said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the legalization regions of self-employment and summary data from regions with proposals and issues (available at the disposal of the editorial office).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the relevant ministries, the consolidated data from the regions are also directed to the heads of the regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step towards such an exchange and will be the direction of the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the Senator’s “Parliamentary Gazette”.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, in many regions of the country, support programs for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, in Vologda region, the Entrepreneurship Support Centre operates, which, in addition to financial support measures, promotes businessmen in the certification of finished products.</seg>

<seg id="19">Self-employed continue to withdraw from the shadow</seg>
<seg id="20">In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurship activities”, as this “the most corresponds to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend, providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the finishing and repair of residential premises, cottages, physical training sessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unfair producers of dairy products with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".</seg>
<seg id="24">And in Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate the consolidation of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and directions of support of social entrepreneurship in the legal and regulatory field.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programs for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delivery of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The Government of the Russian Federation calculated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo decreased more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report sent to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, Interfax reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 m. with $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">These are the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited products was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that at the end of August the government extended to 31 December 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia within the framework of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document posted on the official portal of legal information noted that the duration of the regulations was extended for another year - from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the decree on the destruction of sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from 1 January 2016 - Ukraine have joined the list.</seg>
<seg id="11">The signed decree on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products, food embargoes, which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the Government had allowed the destruction of “sanctions” in any legitimate manner.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the Western sanctions persist, the Russian Federation also extended its response.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, on products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="15">The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called "simple immoral" the destruction of food, and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the upbringing of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor delivered an initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for use in early June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following this similar recommendation, the Government gave the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.</seg>
