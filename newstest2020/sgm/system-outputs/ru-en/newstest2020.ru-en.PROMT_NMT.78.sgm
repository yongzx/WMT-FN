<seg id="1">TikTok hides objectionable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian says.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents found at the publication say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) using the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations related to Chinese policy fall under the "incitement to hatred."</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places objectionable publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning Tiananmen Square incidents or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also contains a list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park KyDand Prime Renee, President Indonesia Indonesia</seg>
<seg id="11">Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may lead to user blocking.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also attract independent local specialists."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Production Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially collaborates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Production Center coordinates all advertising materials of bloggers with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, Bogdanov reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked whether TikTok can speak out about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "TikTok lists the basic rules for users in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminating statements, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="23">By user agreement, only persons over 13 years old can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, Bogdanov says.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.</seg>

<seg id="5">Otherwise, they refuse him to return.</seg>

<seg id="4">One of the most famous comic book heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel film universe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in franchise films.</seg>
<seg id="6">This became known from a Sony press release, which says that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of revenues, which is why Spider-Man will leave the Marvel film universe.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.</seg>

<seg id="10">As a result, Sony received revenue from revenue in film cashiers, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.</seg>
<seg id="11">As reported, at some point such a situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Marvel Studios President Kevin Feigi said he was delighted.</seg>

<seg id="17">At the same time, Feigi recalled that Sony is also creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It so happened that he is the only superpower-endowed hero who finds himself in different film generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, while Sony continues to develop its own Spidy Universe, the future may present unexpected surprises, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, obviously commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from The Wolf of Wall Street, in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"</seg>

<seg id="24">The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel film universe caused anger among many loyal fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Details of the new terms have not yet been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have collaborated perfectly over the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans of [Spider-Man].</seg>

<seg id="4">According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not be indicated on the package.</seg>

<seg id="1">Regions offered to share secrets of business support</seg>
<seg id="2">As it became known to the Parliamentary newspaper, on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">It is time to establish interregional ties</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the business development and legalization programs of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Today, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by senators identified the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country," said Andrei Kutepov.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive achievements of regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (available to the editors).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on positive achievements in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, "the senator told the Parliamentary newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate support programs for small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, in the Vologda Oblast there is an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in conducting certification of finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Krasnodar Territory, novice agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Oryol region there is a cluster development center.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Amur Region, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises," provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="19">Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the tent "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," since this "most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, country buildings, and physical training classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers using the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they are advocating the consolidation in the regulatory field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deliveries of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of prohibited products were compensated by increasing imports from CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document posted on the official portal of legal information noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the decree on the destruction of the sanction extended to products from the USA, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of "sanctions" illegally imported into the country (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctions" food in any legal way.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions persist, the Russian Federation also extended its retaliatory measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food products "simply immoral," and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption in early June.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, the Presidential Human Rights Council made a similar recommendation to the government.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and you need to think about how you can use it for your purpose, assessing the quality.</seg>

<seg id="2">This was reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).</seg>
<seg id="3">According to ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European Ultra-Large Telescope") will be located, is still the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's doubles.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT were announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.</seg>
