<seg id="1">TikTok hides unwanted videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen square, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the documents that appeared in the publication, it is told that the owner of TikTok (bytedance company) uses the app to promote the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations related to Chinese policy fall under the category of"hate speech".</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context that fits the General rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticizing China's socialist system falls under the General ban on " criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.".</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries".</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong UN, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-Hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra modi, the document said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Posts from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may result in the user being blocked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Non-strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian TikTok users do not have specific restrictions on publishing, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production center.</seg>
<seg id="16">Producer center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without approval, reports Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen similar publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Roman Zaripov, the founder of Our Didgital Agency, agrees with Bogdanov: "the Main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules, you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Administrators of the social network check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.</seg>

<seg id="3">The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another matter is how timely its introduction is in our country.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," V. Matvienko said.</seg>

<seg id="7">This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system and its regulatory legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to ensure that pensions and social security of citizens improve.</seg>
<seg id="9">But steps in this direction should be considered, responsible, taking into account domestic realities, " Matvienko told RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The head of the Federal budget stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) is developed, several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.</seg>
<seg id="11">On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the submission of a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delivery of "sanctions" in Russia fell to 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government has estimated that deliveries of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that have fallen under the Russian food embargo have decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctioned countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are talking about the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of prohibited products were compensated by increasing imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the term of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported to Russia as part of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document published on the official portal of legal information noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the decree on the destruction of sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein have "joined" this list, and since January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">Putin signed a decree on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctionki" (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food in any legal way.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its response.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Mikhail Fedotov, head of the presidential Council for the development of civil society and human rights, previously called the destruction of food "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, the Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food that is suitable for consumption in early June.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, a similar recommendation was made to the government by the human rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexey Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.</seg>
