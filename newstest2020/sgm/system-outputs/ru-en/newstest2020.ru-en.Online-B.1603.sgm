<seg id="1">TikTok hides objectionable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">TikTok's Chinese social network censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or a banned Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents that came to the publication, said that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) using the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bulk of China’s policy violations fall under "hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places unwanted publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, a ban on criticizing China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticizing or attacking the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning Tiananmen Square incidents or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also contains a list of the banned names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen,” including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may lead to user blocking.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and we also involve independent local specialists."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the "Producer Center".</seg>
<seg id="16">The Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially collaborates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All production materials of bloggers by the "Producer Center" are coordinated with representatives of the social network, but custom materials can be posted without approval, Bogdanov reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked whether TikTok could speak out about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered in the affirmative and said that he had seen such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">The founder of Our Didgital agency Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules, you can bring any content that the moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">By user agreement, only persons over 13 years old can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: a neural network analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.</seg>

<seg id="3">The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another thing is how timely its introduction is with us.</seg>

<seg id="7">The foregoing does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we are obligated to do everything to improve the size of pensions and the social security of citizens.</seg>

<seg id="6">This was announced in a press release from Sony, which states that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.</seg>

<seg id="10">As a result, Sony earned revenue from movie sales, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.</seg>

<seg id="17">At the same time, Feigi recalled that Sony is creating its own movie universe, built just around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It so happened that he is the only hero endowed with superpower who finds himself in different film universes.</seg>

<seg id="25">Details of the new conditions have not been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked very well over the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans of [Spider-Man].</seg>

<seg id="1">Regions invited to share business support secrets</seg>
<seg id="2">As it became known to the Parliamentary Gazeta, on September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">It's time to establish interregional ties</seg>
<seg id="4">The Council of the Federation Committee on Economic Policy has summarized the information received from the regions about the programs for business development and legalization of the self-employed in them, as well as the results of such programs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent suggestions for improving the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by senators identified the issue of the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programs in the country as a whole," said Andrei Kutepov.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the appendix to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with suggestions and problems (available to the publisher).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to specialized ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step towards such an exchange will be to forward the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, "the senator told the Parliamentary newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, in many regions of the country, support programs for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, in the Vologda Oblast there is an Enterprise Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed that provides for the implementation of the one-window principle through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Oryol region operates a cluster development center.</seg>
<seg id="17">Amur Region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators, created on the basis of existing non-governmental coworking centers, at the expense of the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="19">Self-employed continue to withdraw from the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", since it "is most consistent with the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to introduce amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities in the decoration and repair of residential premises, summer cottages, and physical education classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers using the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate for the notion of "social entrepreneurship" and directions for supporting social entrepreneurship in the legal field.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>
<seg id="26">“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills,” Andrei Kutepov assured.</seg>

<seg id="2">The airline Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where small children will be sitting.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, if you want a neighborhood with them you can avoid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid an unwanted neighborhood with small children.</seg>

<seg id="6">When choosing seats in the cabin during the booking of tickets, passengers will be able to see the image of the child’s head in places occupied by children aged eight days to two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, those who do not want to fly near the kids because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying, can be located as far away from them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Internet users who use the services of the airline, were delighted with the innovation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the users complained that a few weeks ago he flew from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting right next to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commentator suggested introducing "adult flights", expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many tourists noted that they will now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their movements, since they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, a woman traveling with a baby, tried to appease fellow travelers during the flight Seoul - San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="14">She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each of which had an apology note.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deliveries of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">The government of the Russian Federation estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctions countries compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $ 226.5 million from $ 4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited products was offset by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that at the end of August the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food that are prohibited from being imported into Russia under counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">A document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the validity of the rules was extended by one more year, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the sanction destruction order extended to products from the United States, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein “joined” this list, and from January 1, 2016, Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">A decree signed by Putin on the elimination of "sanctions" (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) illegally brought into the country entered into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food by any legal means.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its retaliatory measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called "simply immoral" the destruction of food, and this, he said, negatively affects the education of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, the Rospotrebnadzor came up with an initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, the Presidential Human Rights Council gave a similar recommendation to the government.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food products, and you need to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, evaluating the quality.</seg>
