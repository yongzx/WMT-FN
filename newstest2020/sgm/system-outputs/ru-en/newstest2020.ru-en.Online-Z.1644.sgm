<seg id="1">TikTok hides bad videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 % of which are under 18 years old</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mention Tianmen Square, Tibet independence, or Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents found in the publication, it is told that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance), with the application promotes China's foreign policy goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main part of China's policy violations fall under "incitement to hate".</seg>
<seg id="7">In every case, TikTok puts unacceptable publications in a context that fits the general rules so that social network does not look censored.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc. d"..</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning incidents in Tianananmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under "distortion of the history of China or other countries".</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also contains a list of prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-Ir, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese premier Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyn Hee, Indonesia President Joko Vidodo and Indian premiere Narendra Modi, indicated in the document.</seg>
<seg id="11">The prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by social networks administrators and may result in blocking the user.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations apply to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are obsolete and no longer apply: "Now we are using a localized approach to moderation, and also attract independent local specialists".</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on the publication, co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov tells.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Producer Center" is one Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of the bloggers "Producer Center" harmonizes with social network representatives, but custom materials can be posted without agreement, Bogdanov says.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question is it possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers affirmatively and says he has seen such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bogdanov agrees with Bogdanov by the founder of the agency Our Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users lists in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content that discriminate statements and so on".</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules you can summarize any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov agency is another Russian partner TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 % of whom are under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years old can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social media administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neuronetwork analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, Bogdanov tells.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neuronetwork decides that the user is younger, his account can delete, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.</seg>
