<seg id="1">TikTok hides unsuitable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet ’s independence, or Falun Gong ’s banned religious group, says The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents at the publication tell that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company), using the application, promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations related to China ’s policies fall under “hate speech. ”</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticizing China ’s socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc. ”..</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries ”.</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also contains a list of the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politics Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Premier.</seg>
<seg id="11">The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and can lead to the blocking of the user.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not too strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach for modeling, as well as attract independent local specialists."</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All advertising materials of the bloggers “Producer Center ” agree with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement, Bogdanov reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked whether it is possible to speak out about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says he saw such publications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bogdanov is agreed by Our Didgital agency founder Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users list in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content that discriminates against statements and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">But under these rules, you can bring down any content that the moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the user agreement, only people over 13 years old can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">Social network administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: neuroscience analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neurosis decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork carpet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Regions were invited to share business support secrets</seg>
<seg id="2">As the Parliamentary Newspaper became aware, on 27 September, Andrei Kutepov, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, sent a letter to Maxima Oreshkin, Minister of Economic Development, and Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance, inviting them to take a position on the initiatives of the Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="3">Time to establish interregional links</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy compiled information from the regions on their business development and self-employment legalization programmes, as well as on the results of such programmes.</seg>
<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Today, communication between regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the senatorial visit identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programs in general across the country, ” Andrei Kutepov noted.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional experiences on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of proposals and issues from the regions (available).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the line ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on good practices in the regions could give impetus to enterprise development in general.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, "the Senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully implemented programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, the Volodsk Region has an Enterprise Support Centre which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the single window principle through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Krasnodar Krai, starting agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the funds of the provincial budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Orlovsk region has a cluster development center.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Amur region, as part of the federal project “Accommodation of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurs ”, provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of existing non-state cowerking centers from the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="19">Self-employed continue to be removed from the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">In the view of regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be introduced to better support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed replacing the term “self-employment ” with“ entrepreneurial activity ”, since this “is most consistent with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens ”.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ivanovo region, amendments are considered necessary to expand the range of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the separation and repair of residential premises, dachments, and physical training.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control of unscrupulous dairy producers through the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the inclusion in the legal framework of the concept of “social entrepreneurship ” and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="25">All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>
<seg id="26">“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills, ” Andrei Kutepov assured.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sanctions deliveries to Russia fell 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Russian government, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">This involves the supply of goods that were not subject to the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As indicated in the report, imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia have been offset by increases in the volume of prohibited imports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia as part of counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">A document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for a further year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially, the destruction order was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined this list, from January 1, 2016-Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">Putin ’s decree on the destruction of “sanctions ” illegally imported into the country (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanctions ” food in any legal way.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Western sanctions continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, products that citizens import for personal use are not subject to this measure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the “simply immoral ” destruction of food, and this, according to him, negatively affects the upbringing of people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for use in early June.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that, the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation made a similar recommendation to the Government.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said it was wrong to destroy food products, and you need to think about how you can use them for purpose, evaluating quality.</seg>
