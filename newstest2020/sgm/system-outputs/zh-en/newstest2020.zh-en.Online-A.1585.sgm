<seg id="1">The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!</seg>
<seg id="2">On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team won two games in a row in the case of the opponent back to a city, and finally with 3:1 Rick Holland, ushered in a nine-game winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="3">The World Cup is nearing the end of the schedule, although the defending in sight, but against Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team still can not be taken lightly.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the first two games against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team's performance was as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 to go down to the first two cities, until the third game, the team encountered a setback.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dutch women in the backward situation to strengthen the attack of the ball, the Chinese team a pass was affected, coupled with the girls attack heart, mistakes also began to increase, and finally with 21:25 by the opponent back to a city.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the game Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "In the third game, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points." "</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball before the game also made difficult preparations, although lost a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's grasp, " and the strong team to win or lose the game is normal, play five games is also normal, so we said to the players to focus, " Lang Ping said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the fourth inning, the players actively adjust the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the firepower all open, a single game to get 8 points, for the team to win a great job.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation is now only two rounds, although the Chinese women's volleyball has touched the championship trophy, but against the Netherlands team did sound the alarm bell for the Chinese women:the more critical the moment, the more to go all out.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the other match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball team played five games, the United States team failed to take all three points from the opponent, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team in the match against Serbia to take all three points, can advance to the first round to achieve the defending.</seg>
<seg id="11">All kinds of things are moving towards the favorable situation of the Chinese women's volleyball.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, although the Serbian team's six main teams are missing, but this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="13">Judging from the current form of the points table, the Serbian team has been basically no medal, which means that they can play against the Chinese women's volleyball match "lightly on the line", put down the burden to fully impact the opponent, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the championship, the state may be ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the substitute Sedas are not "slaughter" lambs, previously with the Netherlands, the two sides in five games, Serbia's second team finally 3:2 reversed the Dutch full-back line-up, which can be seen the depth of its lineup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before the start of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the Dutch and Serbian teams are not good to deal with: "Osaka's game will be very difficult, we still have to continue to prepare carefully." "</seg>
<seg id="16">Now that the horn of the defending title has been blown, the game has really entered the "white heat stage".</seg>
<seg id="17">On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team are above the opponent, but the last moment, but also to see whether the girls can play the normal level, in the arena to release themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 26th, the former French President Jacques Chirac died suddenly, aged 86.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a time when the world is in a century of unturned change, the French politician's many political legacies left in power are still worthy of our praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Chirac has been French president for 12 years in a charismatic manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Charles de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was the representative figure of the pursuit of the "European dream".</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he is also a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world, is a strategic vision of the politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is why the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".</seg>
<seg id="8">One of Chirac's relishing political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under his leadership, France joined forces with Germany to resist American pressure and walk in the forefront of the anti-war.</seg>
<seg id="10">A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="11">It turned out that Chirac's warning was correct.</seg>
<seg id="12">At a time when European integration is in tatout and The unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choice on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment significance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Chirac is also a French politician who has made Chinese familiar and kind.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Sino-French relations, and after being first elected president of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a strategic vision of politicians.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="16">During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and bilateral cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields made breakthrough progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Year of Chinese-French Culture, initiated by Chirac, has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.</seg>
<seg id="18">Chirac's lifelong love of Chinese culture was particularly impressive.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to Chinese diplomats who are understood to be his, Chirac can carry some of Li Bai and Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Don't look at the pyramids is not really to Egypt, don't look at Qin Qi really to China" - this gold sentence comes from Chirac.</seg>
<seg id="21">In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency , Chirac said : The West has concerns about China's political and social development , the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political position in the world .</seg>
<seg id="22">But I have confidence in China.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build its ideas and values for harmonious development and to assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that France can not "accept everyone " , but at the same time also strive to " properly accept " .</seg>
<seg id="3">The report said Macron was trying to find a compromise on immigration, slowing the upcoming debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a recent interview during the general debate at the General Assembly in New York, Macron said he hoped there would be a "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macron said : " If France wants to accept (immigrants) properly , it cannot accept everyone , " Macron said .</seg>
<seg id="6">Macron cites four priorities in immigration policy: granting asylum status as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; promoting more efficient integration of migrants; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who enter France illegally and are not suitable for stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the most discussed topic of all time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Macron said he wanted to "assess" the system, but not to abolish it, but to impose restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following Macron's comments, Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Alliance, tweeted that Macron's comments were "empty talk."</seg>
<seg id="10">The president of the Senate, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "detente" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Varoual, a left-wing Socialist lawmaker, said France should "accept more and better" on immigration and criticised Mr Macron for "manipulating" the issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reported that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time failed to appease the right-wing opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of far-right attacks in the next 2022 election, and Macron needs to do something about it, but at the same time risk angering the left within the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lower house of the French National Assembly is reportedto debate immigration policy from September 30, while the Senate will debate it from October 2.</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over a meeting of foreign ministers of China and African members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2">African Current Security Council Members Ivorian Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Oyono, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and Member-designate Niger Foreign Minister Carla, Tunisian Foreign Minister Jesinawi and others attended the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening Cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, by uniting to make strength.</seg>
<seg id="5">The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the direct consequence that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations being undermined to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, side by side, unity can be strength.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not only on the three votes, but on the entire African continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">China and Africa stand together, not just by four votes, but by driving other countries to follow suit, influencing and shaping the agenda of the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2018, China and African members of the Security Council have established a "3-plus-one" coordination mechanism to make full use of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Second, the settlement of disputes is through consultation.</seg>
<seg id="11">China has always advocated a political solution to hot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as experience in the successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the complex issues on the Council's agenda, particularly in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation and so on.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau 'people's set collapses', can he be re-elected</seg>
<seg id="2">This time, Mr. Trudeau tripped out of a "big hole" that Mr. Trudeau himself dug up a little.</seg>
<seg id="3">In recent days, Canadian media have released a series of old photos of the current prime minister, Mr. Trudeau, posing as a black man.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was considered an apparent act of racial discrimination that caused a stir in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.</seg>
<seg id="6">Canadians, however, don't buy much.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trudeau was stoned to his feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black-faced movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile critics of the opposition or dissent in the party in this regard "big loss" and repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake should be immediately expelled".</seg>
<seg id="9">Simply put, this time it's a big hole that tripped Trudeau out of his head, and it was Mr. Trudeau himself who dug it out a little.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and he has had a whirlwind of "political idols" when he first came out.</seg>
<seg id="11">Originally a "political man", he took over as leader of the federal Liberal Party, and after winning an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections, when the Federal Liberals won a valuable single cabinet in the lower house of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, Mr. Trudeau put forward a number of deafening platforms and ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "eco-environmental protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the eradication of corruption and "improper winds".</seg>
<seg id="13">However , in his five years in power , he has been in a tailspin in almost all of the above , " high and low . "</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of "ethnicity and gender equality", the "blackface" incident aside, after he "didn't speak up" on a series of issues related to First Nations, led first nations groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gates of Parliament Heights on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the fight against corruption, Mr. Trudeau became embroiled in the tumultuous "Lan Wanling affair" late last year and early this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was revealed that his hometown of the construction company "Lan Wanling" major violations of private fraud cases, to the department responsible for the investigation and prosecution of the department and officials pressure, the latter "high-lifting hands."</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Mr. Trudeau, after the furore, was infuriated by the official who disclosed the case, Mr. Wang, who was the first to disclose the case and who was canada's attorney-general at the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the case itself is still suspect, its suspicion is difficult to wash away.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many observers point out that Mr. Trudeau's five years in power have collapsed mainly because of his own "pits", which are no more than "tiger-headed" "self-inflicted" and "broader than self-discipline, strict eras".</seg>
<seg id="20">Since 2015, support for Mr. Trudeau has slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents have soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent, according to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll.</seg>
<seg id="21">While other opposition parties and their party chiefs have done just as well, even a significant proportion of voters who still want to vote for the federal Liberal party are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and leader of the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="22">On October 21st, as the new Canadian federal legislative elections begin, will Mr. Trudeau repeat the drama of his triumph five years ago?</seg>
<seg id="23">The answer may be one word: difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin development integration level, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.</seg>
<seg id="2">On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="3">Beijing News reporter from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission was informed that the capital airport has been in a super-saturated operation state, the opening of Daxing International Airport, will enhance the capital's aviation service capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is mainly similar to international shipping, the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the domestic and international different aviation business differentiation positioning, to provide a more segmented service.</seg>
<seg id="5">Daxing Airport, from a business development point of view, for the capital airport is more favorable impact.</seg>
<seg id="6">Capital Airport in 2018 passenger throughput exceeded 100 million passengers, ranking first in the country, but compared with the rapid growth of business needs, there is still a clear capacity difference, especially international routes demand gap.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to better serve the domestic and foreign passenger travel, travel and other needs, to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open, international integration of the city's development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers, cargo and postal throughput of 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, the two airportpositioning does not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, but also have enough market space.</seg>
<seg id="9">From the economic account level, Daxing International Airport's navigation, obviously will form a win-win effect, ease the tension of Beijing's air capacity, speed up the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, to create the capital aviation dual-core operation of the incremental cake.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, the future need not all focus on the capital airport travel, can also reduce the route too concentrated brought about by a series of problems, such as longer station guarantee time, passengerboarding speed slower, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers stranded at the airport time, increase the burden of airport operation, through the capital airport shipping burden, in fact, also improve the passenger travel experience.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the media to go to the large international airport a variety of transportation routes time and cost estimates, such as from the South Fifth Ring Road to beijing to open high-speed directly on Daxing Airport high-speed, driving 50 minutes can go to, oil money back and forth about 40 yuan, high-speed fee 15 yuan; Daxing Airport Line, according to the distance of 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers for the limit, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three, the public can also take the Beijing-Hongxiong intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station as long as 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, there are a variety of modes of transport options available to the public to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.</seg>
<seg id="13">And from the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is the location of Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin transportation hub, so the distance from Beijing is slightly far, but strengthen the radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, convenient for more people to travel, to pull Hebei, Tianjin's economic development is of great significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.</seg>
<seg id="15">Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to the Beijing District direct to Daxing Airport's new airport line, there are a number of highways connected to Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just as passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through Guangfu, Guangshen and other highways, residents of Langfang, Xiong'an New District and other places around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport, access to convenient and efficient air services.</seg>
<seg id="17">From this, it can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport, not only added several runways and several aircraft, whether from the competitive level of enterprises, consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin development integration level, have far-reaching and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, for the vast number of residents of Beijing and Tianjin to provide a variety of options, promote the further improvement of the quality of service of the Beijing shipping industry, but also conducive to the development of Beijing-Tianjin integration, To promote the economic and trade development of the surrounding area of Daxing Airport.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the small account of individuals in the economy, but also the overall development of the big account.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum held in Chengtian Hue Province</seg>
<seg id="2">At the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new signs and continued to maintain growth, said Nguyen Dejian, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, some outstanding issues of the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and projections and recommendations for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was widely felt that global economic growth would slow in the first few months of 2019 and that risks and challenges would increase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrank global trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that despite the global economic uncertainty, with 70 percent of the world's economies stagnant, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many encouraging achievements, with stable macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, and the consumer price index grew by an average of 2.64 percent in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth rate in nearly three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">GDP grew by 6.76 % in the first half of 2019 , although down from 7.05 % in the same period last year , but still at a high level compared with the level for the same period in 2011-2017 .</seg>
<seg id="9">In predicting the trend of Vietnam's economic development in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said vietnam's economy is showing high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of various FTAs will boost trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement will be further strengthened, as a result of trade frictions, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, we should strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnam's exports, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create facilities for the export of agricultural and aquatic products and other commodities.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Witness the ten-year "cloud rise" of digital China in Yunji Town - Xinhua</seg>
<seg id="2">If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25-27 in Hangzhou, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference has been a full decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the concept of "in the clouds" to the practice of "up to the cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies to support China's economic development, social management and public service in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">In The Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new "colleague" with Alibaba Cloud Artificial Intelligence was recently filled by a quality inspector.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is 24 hours a day, the speed of identification is more than twice the manual, quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to company officials, the camera with the "quality inspector" has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language, there will be defective battery chips classified.</seg>
<seg id="7">This enterprise is just one microcosm of today's cloud computing transformation that is driving manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of The Cloud for Enterprises (2018-2020) in 2018, and proposes that by 2020, the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on the cloud will be significantly improved, and the proportion and application depth of the upper cloud will be significantly increased.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for a digital economy that is a key element of data, said Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, in the past 10 years, China's cloud computing industry has been expanding in size.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Information and Communications Research Institute in July this year, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 % over 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly changed urban management and social life.</seg>
<seg id="13">The "urban brain", which has been on display for the third year in a row, is still a cause for concern at this year's Cloud Habitat Conference.</seg>
<seg id="14">Alibaba Cloud, the current urban brain has been from traffic management tools to urban management hub, related to cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain through powerful computing power, so that "stop first and pay later" "the number of visitors in real time awareness" "travel line design" and other new urban management services functions to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the field of government affairs services, with "one cloud" docking "one thing", the "palm office" "hands on the work" co-promotion, cloud computing for the supply of government services to bring convenience.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform through the government affairs cloud.</seg>
<seg id="18">As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, collecting data from 3,066 categories of 19.08 billion.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average monthly call-up and sharing of data between government departments in Zhejiang province has reached 12 million times, and every time the data flows on the 'cloud', it may mean that the masses are running errands less.</seg>

<seg id="1">Make tea with plastic tea bags with caution!</seg>
<seg id="2">A new canadian study has found that a pack of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even tens of billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans, the Central News Agency reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers at Magill University in Canada have reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics an estimated person consumes throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, showed researchers testing four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montevideo shops and cafes, opening them, washing them and dipped in almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study , they found that more than 11.6 billion plastic particles were released in a single tea bag , " several stages higher than the plastic load of other foods before . "</seg>
<seg id="8">Reported that most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many use natural fiber single brands still use plastic to seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the branded tea bags are no longer made of paper in favour of plastic, which the researchers tested.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that the researchers define as being between 100 nanometres and 5 mm in size, mainly caused by the decomposition of plastic waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea ditches around the world, as well as microplastics in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers first found plastic particles in human stool samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian team put water fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affect their behavior and cause them to develop deformities.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what effects they have on humans.</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released by these tea bags may be due to their contact with boiling water, which may break down or ooze toxic substances even when "food-grade" plastics are heated above 40 degrees Celsius.</seg>

<seg id="1">Guterres said a climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.</seg>
<seg id="2">There, a natural disaster can erode a generation's development gains.</seg>
<seg id="3">The hurricane-hit areas of Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas so far this year illustrate this point.</seg>
<seg id="4">About a quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.</seg>
<seg id="5">Relocation can have serious implications for their social and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.</seg>
<seg id="6">At Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction by working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The climate crisis is putting new injustices on the old ones , " Guterres said .</seg>
<seg id="8">Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these countries are in middle-income status, many are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">The world must act, and it is time for major decisions and substantial investment in small island developing States. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for help to small island developing States to manage disaster risk, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy, and urged international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, access funding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.</seg>
<seg id="13">The intergovernmental panel on Climate Change's latest special report this week confirms that the oceans have suffered the "sweeping" consequences of the climate crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the middle of this century, many regions may experience some extreme sea level rise that would have occurred once a century ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">The report warns that some island States are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken a heavy toll.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.</seg>
<seg id="18">Demand shipping, mining and tourism are leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="20">They rely heavily on external markets, subject ingress to price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere, " Guterres said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that can be used around the world. "</seg>
<seg id="24">He stressed that small island developing States were an exception to sustainable development.</seg>

<seg id="5">Recently, the author's university to carry out rain pollution diversion project, the campus appeared a lot of migrant workers, if you pay attention to observe, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over-age migrant workers go out to work is not "idle", but because "can't be idle", with "have to be so" helplessness and hardship - whether it is saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or helping their children, are driving these should "free down" old people continue to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "old-fashioned" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we think.</seg>
<seg id="8">Parenting children, supporting the elderly, for children to read, help children build buildings to buy cars, help children to start a family, next generation to raise grandchildren, when these migrant workers completed the "life task", money bags have been hollowed out and even a lot of debt, most lack of wealth accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order not to drag down the children also in order to save some wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "dry to dry up."</seg>
<seg id="10">Many "post-80s" "post-90" and even "post-00" new generation of migrant workers are not willing to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity of the secondary industry or low-end service industry, resulting in a structural "job shortage", these unattractive jobs, to provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor ability and decline, many over-age migrant workers are doing high intensity, low income, high risk, less protection of the work.</seg>
<seg id="12">Can do a day is a day, can earn a little more, "cannot idle" behind the survival dilemma of over-age migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="13">To solve the problem of underpayment and demand for wages, improve labor protection, reduce security risks, increase labor income, improve the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-rescue", but also inseparable from the public sector system protection and humane care.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are less likely to rely on home-grown land to solve their old-age care and medical problems, they must otherwise support their families.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reading the "can't be idle" of migrant workers " helpless ness and strong, help us to better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Seeing the back of the over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to get back to the countryside they really realize the "old-fashioned", the need for the public sector, the market and society in the benign interaction of responsibility, the need for multi-party efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chemezov said Russia will not export such a system for the next five years because "the country's military will be supplied first before export production".</seg>
<seg id="2">This approach is fully in line with international practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">Major producers of arms and military equipment always first ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier, General Yuri Grekhov, deputy commander of the Russian Air Force, said the development of the system was nearing completion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Konzern.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a new generation of air defense systems that work to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near-space.</seg>
<seg id="9">Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sergey Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.</seg>
<seg id="11">He says the system is in great demand in the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to information on 15 September, the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic Air Defence Regiment of Sindi Island has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Russian Defense Ministry said it was a complete process in the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the northern strategic direction.</seg>
<seg id="16">"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly, " said the Russian Northern Fleet News Service. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Crucially, the system has been successful lying in the Arctic and the Arctic, according to military assessments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Air defense regiment officers and soldiers have been trained in the new system and are ready to enter combat duty.</seg>
<seg id="19">Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it is still partially retained.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether they are targets flying at high speeds at outer altitudes or "fish in the net" close to protected facilities.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by The Golden Diamond-Antey Sky Defense, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow its own development path.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since modern times, in the environment of accumulation of poverty and weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people in order to explore the way to save the country and the people up and down, go forward to follow.</seg>
<seg id="5">However , " the constitutional monarchy , the restoration of the imperial system , the parliamentary system , the multi-party system , the presidential system have all been tried and tried , and the results have not worked . " "</seg>
<seg id="6">It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist road with Chinese characteristics in practice.</seg>
<seg id="7">This road that China has come out of is the road to the well-being of the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely because it is on the right path that China can do its own thing well, in order to become the world's second largest economy, the largest contribution to global economic growth, in order to continue to benefit the world through its own development.</seg>
<seg id="9">As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions, to meet the requirements of the times, will be with the times to show more and more bright prospects for development.</seg>
<seg id="10">Looking back, Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path, and look around the world, Chinese people cherish this right path more.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese understand the truth of the South Orange North, understand that suitable for others do not necessarily suitable for their own, only suitable for their own is the best.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a remarkable miracle.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the tortuous process of human's advance, "The Thetheory of The End of History" was famous for some time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics has declared the end of the "end of history theory", the collapse of "China's collapse theory" and the failure of the "socialist failure theory".</seg>
<seg id="15">China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve the prosperity of their people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and reference for countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate their development and maintain their independence, and to follow the path that is in line with their national conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">The world is rich and colorful.</seg>
<seg id="17">China has always respected the right of all countries to choose the path of development that suits their national conditions.</seg>
<seg id="18">China does not "import" the foreign model, nor "exports" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with other countries in governance, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance and governance.</seg>

<seg id="9">In three years she has only missed one shift, and the "missing amount" totals a few Australian dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal "had nothing to do with her actions or performance."</seg>
<seg id="11">" It seems to me that the real motive of the defender to dismiss Mr. Wang is that he prefers to hire employees with an Asian background , supported by the evidence of the job advertisement released by Mr. Wang , " he said .</seg>

<seg id="2">BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new U.S. study.</seg>
<seg id="3">But with a full score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the study's authors, Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans still eat too much food that could cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, the most common diseasein u.S. citizens.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 24.</seg>
<seg id="7">The study is based on the findings of a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Despite significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain, " the authors write.</seg>
<seg id="9">These challenges are known to include getting U.S. citizens to cut back on snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended 10 percent intake limit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent , but the intake was still too high .</seg>
<seg id="12">Officials believe that the intake of added sugar scann saued at less than 10 % in the daily diet .</seg>
<seg id="13">Researchers believe it is related to a reduction in people's consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less-than-sweet foods such as yogurt and ketchup.</seg>
<seg id="14">U.S. adults have a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain categories.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5 % of the daily diet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and a reduction in drinking fruit juice leading to a low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang said they still account for up to 42 percent of daily calories, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">These health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="19">The government's dietary guidelines for U.S. residents recommend a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce their risk of chronic disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">The guidelines say people should consume more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and protein-provided seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled during the study period, more than 7 percent, and obesity rates increased over many years of the study -- about 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy "report card."</seg>
<seg id="2">The second quarter of the U.S. economic "report card" showed that U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed significantly from the previous quarter, driven by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it brought with them were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Final revision data released by the U.S. Commerce Department on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2 % in the second quarter , unchanged from the previously released revision , but significantly lower than the 3.1 % in the first quarter .</seg>
<seg id="5">Data show that consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Personal consumption spending , which accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy , grew by 4.6 % quarter-on-quarter , boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points .</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, government spending and investment led to economic growth of 0.82 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="8">However , private sector investment fell by 6.3 % in the second quarter from the previous quarter , dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter , while exports fell by 5.7 % from the previous quarter , and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter .</seg>
<seg id="9">Private sector investment has not only failed to maintain last year's growth, but has fallen sharply as rising economic frictions and uncertainty have hit business confidence, says Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ainside Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Knap believes U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in decline next year, influenced by policy uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="11">Analysts believe that while consumer growth has provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the Outlook for U.S. Consumption.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan and the study's lead author.</seg>
<seg id="13">Analysts generally expect the U.S. economy to continue to slow in the future.</seg>
<seg id="14">But some experts say the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions ease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Keryn Birch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the US economy to continue its downward trend this year and slow to a lower level than in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Analytics , predicts that the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 % this year and slow further to 1.6 % next year , assuming economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate .</seg>
<seg id="17">Ellen Harzen, investment manager at Putnam Investments, points out that the biggest concern for companies right now is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainties they bring, and if they are resolved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced and the industrial sector will perform much better than it does now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Matt Meli, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions remain "top issues" and the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in U.S. capital markets this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The transfer of state-owned funds to enrich the social security fund - from the "enrich the social security fund money bag" starting point, the destination is to provide a strong support for the old-age security.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but opened the "mathematical addition".</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice on the Comprehensive Pushing and Transfer of Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Work of the Social Security Fund, which clearly defined the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, that is, the central and local transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund work in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were quickly implemented.</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of its stake in ICBC and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two equity transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the provisions, the Social Security Foundation and other undertaking subjects as financial investors, enjoy the state-owned shares assigned to the right to income, disposal and the right to know.</seg>
<seg id="7">ICBC and AgBank said in the announcement that the change in equity will not cause changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this regard, the author believes that similar transfer of state-owned enterprises equity transfer is not a simple change of equity ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first step of some state-owned transfer of social security , the "addition results " , is naturally able to reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people , and the development results are shared by the whole population .</seg>
<seg id="10">After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises in China's economy are mostly in important industries and areas, the overall profitability is strong and more stable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, leading enterprises are continuously achieving better and bigger and stronger.</seg>
<seg id="12">On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to fully push forward the transfer of some state-owned capital this year to enrich the work of the social security fund.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Executive Meeting of the State Council, to do a good job in the comprehensive push to transfer part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the basic old-age insurance system intergenerational equity and the development of state-owned enterprises to share the results of the whole people.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second step of the transfer, "Addition Results", is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security funds and further strengthen the foundation of the old-age social security system.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and this time as the transfer of the main body of state capital, most of them have the ability to continue to make profits and dividends, not only can effectively supplement the social security fund, but also for the social security fund to provide the source of living water.</seg>
<seg id="16">Estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of deposits on basic old-age insurance can be reduced by 1 percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third step of the transfer, "Addition Results", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="18">The transfer to undertake the main body to obtain revenue is the way is "dividend-based, operation as a supplement".</seg>
<seg id="19">As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund does obtain the main income from equity dividends.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, as a value investor in the capital market, the social security fund has a strong ability to operate capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will help to improve the level of enterprise management and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the social security fund as an investment wind vane, the increase of shareholding weight, is conducive to further enhance its influence in the market, and in the market to play a "stabilizer" role.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it is also beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, and guide investors to invest rationally and value.</seg>

<seg id="2">White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">With China's overall national strength and international influence rapidly rising, the white paper says, some in the international community are worried that China will follow the path of "national power and hegemony", and some have proposed the so-called "China threat theory".</seg>
<seg id="5">This is both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by the power of long-term, and deliberate distortions in order to safeguard one's own vested interests.</seg>
<seg id="6">Realizing national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of all peoples.</seg>
<seg id="7">"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation in the world economic growth to inject new momentum, the future of China's economic stabilization and power source role is more prominent.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, the world's economic growth is not enough, the sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">China's economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continues to upgrade, and new economic growth points are emerging.</seg>

<seg id="13">China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for world economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is neither feasible nor harmful to "de-link" China from the world economy by treating China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" and trying to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">The white paper points out that opening up to the outside world in all directions creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend".</seg>
<seg id="16">China unswervingly pursues a win-win strategy of opening up, achieves greater efforts and higher levels of opening-up, has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and larger-scale "going out" benefits more countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-way, one-way benefit."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mutual benefit can last in the long run. "</seg>
<seg id="19">China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, and other countries should expand opening up and take appropriate measures to improve their business environment, the white paper said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Only by moving in the same way can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.</seg>
<seg id="21">The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.</seg>
<seg id="22">This includes promoting high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.</seg>

<seg id="2">Twitter hashtags and social media are trumpeting Egyptians taking to the streets today to peacefully demand the ouster of President Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since the then-military chief, Mr. Sisi, seized power in a military coup in 2013, dissent has all but disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has been plunged into extreme danger.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since protests over the weekend that called for Mr. Sisi's ouster, the Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">Allegations of corruption surrounding Thesis and his family's profligacy in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th.</seg>
<seg id="7">Egypt's Interior Ministry yesterday firmly stated that any attempt to destabilize the country will be decisive, and will not be soft.</seg>
<seg id="8">Central Cairo has long been heavily guarded, with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police strewn across the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's 2011 revolution.</seg>
<seg id="9">Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of key scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Cairo University political science professor and well-known columnist Nafa.</seg>
<seg id="10">He tweeted on the 24th : " I have no doubt that continuing to let Sessy rule be disastrous . " "</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who had served as a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Anan, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anan was arrested last year after trying to run for president with Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="14">The president of the Constitutional Party, Davutoglu, was also detained.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysts and politicians say sweeping dissent reflects the government's instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and the middle class are growing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opposition leader Ayman Nour , a former presidential candidate , said : The crackdown highlights the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how scared it is . "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Because the economy has been messed up by him, and because of widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who may replace them." "</seg>
<seg id="18">Noor pointed out that the government's heavy-handed approach will only increase people's anger in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ali, a businessman and actor who is now in exile in Spain and is a construction contractor for Egypt's military, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, boasting that he had benefited from government corruption and setting off a wave of small-scale demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ali said his company, Amlak General Contract, could get lucrative contracts without having to go through a legal bidding process, stressing the corruption of the military and Sessy's relatives, including first lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was deeply remorseful for his involvement.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ali claims that he helped Sisigai's magnificent palaces and luxury hotels contrast with the current abject life of Egyptians, who have yet to pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="24">On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand up and you're not alone," "Sissy you're done," "Sessy roll" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand That's going down.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="2">Social capital needs to be qualified to obtain the right of rural land management</seg>
<seg id="3">"Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" for public consultation To supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published on the "Rural Land Management Rights Transfer Management Measures (Revised Draft For Comments) " (hereinafter referred to as the "Opinion Draft") for public consultation notice, increasing the social capital transfer of industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights supervision and risk prevention.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Opinion Draft is open to the public for comments from now on.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "three-power separation" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the Transfer and Management of Rural Land Contractmanagement, and formed the Opinion Draft.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the first published "Opinion Draft" has a number of important changes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three-power separation", sets up "land contract management right" and "land management right" respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land management rights (lease, subcontracting, equity or other means) of land contract management rights.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this "Opinion Draft", in order to implement the concept of "three-power separation", effectively respond to the "rural land contracting law" revision of the key purpose, and take into account the transfer of land management rights and land contract management rights exchange, transfer in the parties, procedures, supervision and other aspects of the large differences, the revised draft for the transfer of the scope of circulation, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, transfer methods including leasing, equity, etc. , the name of the regulations from the "rural land transfer management measures" changed to the "rural land transfer management measures."</seg>
<seg id="10">The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights will be separately promulgated as administrative measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Opinion Draft points out that under the background of the "separation of powers", farmers only take stock in the right to operate land for a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="12">Theoretically, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only risk losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is not legally necessary to provide for the return of the contracted land to the original contractor, and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.</seg>
<seg id="13">In view of the problem of preventing the risk of farmers losing their land, preferential shares, rent-after shares and buy-back have been produced in practice.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that the preferred shares have a more mature theoretical discussion in the company law, it is suggested that it should be regarded as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of land.</seg>
