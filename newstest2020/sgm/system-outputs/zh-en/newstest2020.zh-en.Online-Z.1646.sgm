<seg id="1">Women's volleyball is expected to defend the world cup ahead of time</seg>
<seg id="2">On the 27th, the Chinese team was pulled back by their opponent after winning two straight games against the Dutch Women's volleyball, and ended up to a ninth straight win with 3:1 Rick Holland.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the world cup is coming to an end, although the title is in sight, the Chinese women's volleyball can't be taken lightly in the face of Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the first two games against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball performance was as strong as always, with 25:19,25:16 down two cities, until the third round, the team faced setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dutch Women's volleyball increased the offensive in backward situation, and the Chinese team was hit, plus the girls offensive, the mistakes began to increase, and eventually pulled back to a city with 21:25</seg>
<seg id="6">Langping also said in an interview: " in the third round, we sent about 8 points due to mistakes. PM</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the power of Dutch Women's volleyball should not be underestimated. Even before the Chinese women's volleyball game, although i lost a game, everything is still in lang ping's control. "it is normal to win or lose with the strong team, and lose five games. It's normal, so we told the team to focus," lang ping said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the fourth round, the players positively adjusted their status, Zhang changning opened the offensive end. He scored 8 points in a single game to make a big win.</seg>
<seg id="9">So far, there are only two rounds of the 11 rounds left. Although one hand has touched the champions trophy, it does sound a wake-up for Chinese women's volleyball in the match against the Netherlands: the more critical it is moments, the more you have to go out.</seg>
<seg id="10">In another game on the 27th, Russia and the U.S. Women's volleyball filled 5 games, and the U.S. team failed to score all three points from their opponents, so the Chinese women's volleyball is only against Serbia with all three points in the game, you can defend the title in advance.</seg>
<seg id="11">All things are moving towards the favorable situation in China's volleyball.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, while Serbia's top six major players are missing, that doesn't mean they will easily send three points to the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the current form of the scoreboard, Serbia have basically lost the medal, which means they can "Light" against China women's volleyball, let go to hit their opponents with full pressure to win. The State may instead be ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not "slaughtered" Lamb, which was previously in a game against the Netherlands, and Serbia two teams finally turned the Netherlands 3:2 the full main lineup shows the depth of their lineup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before the third stage of the game, lang ping also said that both teams were not easy to deal with: " Osaka will be very difficult, we still have to prepare carefully as always. PM</seg>
<seg id="16">Now that the defending horn has blown, the game is really into the " White heat</seg>
<seg id="17">When it comes to strength, the Chinese women's volleyball is above their opponents. It's only the last crucial moment, and depends on whether women's volleyball girls can play their normal level and release themselves on the court.</seg>

<seg id="2">French President Marlon recently claimed that France cannot " accept all " but at the same time strive to " properly</seg>
<seg id="3">Macron is reportedly trying to find a compromise route on immigration matters to slow the shock of the upcoming debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Recently, in an interview during the general debate in New York, United States, macron expressed his hope for a real "Two-track" programme on immigration policies that strikes a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mark Dragon said: " If France wants to properly accept (migrants), it cannot accept everyone</seg>
<seg id="6">Macron lists four key points of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement illegally into France people who should not stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the national medical assistance system is the most discussed topic before.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mark Dragon said he would like to be able to "Evaluate" the system, but instead of lifting it, but to limit it.</seg>
<seg id="9">After Macron's remarks, far-right " National League " leader le peng tweeted that Mark Dragon's statement was " empty talk</seg>
<seg id="10">Right-Wing Republican and Senate President rasher also said immigration policies should be discussed in a " moderate " but " Face-to reality indirectly criticizing Mark Dragon.</seg>

<seg id="13">In the next general election in 2022, immigration policy topics will once again be the extreme right-wing attack, and macron needs to make a difference on the issue, but at the same time risking the left-wing people in the ruling party.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was considered an apparent act of racism, prompting uproar in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="5">Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public after it happened.</seg>
<seg id="6">Canadians, however, aren't buying.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trudeau was literally throwing a stone and smashed himself in the foot.</seg>
<seg id="8">As political critics Riley and others point out, Trudeau and the federal liberals have been blaming opposition parties or dissidents in this regard since the rise of the United States. Lost "and repeatedly threatened" whoever makes this mistake should be fired immediately</seg>
<seg id="9">In Short, this time trudeau tripped trudeau out of the "big pit" this time was dug up a little by trudeau himself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trudeau, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was young and handsome, who had a whirlwind of "political idol" when he debut.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was originally a " politician who took over as the federal liberal party head, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 federal legislative election - the federal liberals over half of the federal lower house, gain valuable right to stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, Trudeau put forward many deaf platforms, ideas such as " ethnicity and gender equality " Eco-friendly " economic revitalizing highlighting corruption and " bad wind</seg>

<seg id="10">From a user's perspective, with the navigation of daxing international airport, there is no need to concentrate on capital airport in the future, but also reduce a series of problems caused by overconcentration of problems such as the overcrowding time of overcrowding and slowing passenger boarding. Planes and passengers are stranded at the airport, adding to the burden of airport operations, and reducing the burden of shipping through the capital airport, it also improved passenger travel experience.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the media's prediction of the time and cost of multiple transportation routes to the large international airport, if you leave from south fifth ring, direct to daxing airport highway, you can be there in 50 minutes, oil money is 40 around Yuan, the high speed fee is 15 Yuan; while choosing airport line of rail transit railway daxing airport line, the distance is limited to 20 km, the fare is 10 Yuan, 25 Yuan, 30 Yuan, 35 Yuan three stalls; citizens can also take the intercity of jingxiong, from Beijing West station to daxing airport station for more than 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, there are a variety of transportation available for the public to daxing airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.</seg>
<seg id="13">And from the perspective of trend development: daxing airport is located as a traffic hub of Jin Jin-Hebei, so it is a little distance from the city of Beijing, but it strengthens radiation to hebei and tianjin, convenient for more people to travel and tianjin. Zu's economic development is of great significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the future, passengers in hebei and tianjin will enjoy more international air lines services provided by daxing international airport, as seen from the traffic planning of daxing airport.</seg>

<seg id="16">This is just like guangdong dongguan, foshan, qingyuan, qingyuan can go to guangzhou baiyun airport via expressways such as Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou. Residents of the surrounding langfang, xiongan new, get convenient and efficient aviation services.</seg>
<seg id="17">From This, we can see that the navigation of daxing international airport has not only added a few runways and a few aircraft, whether from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience level, but also from regional aviation integration, Beijing-Jin-hei development. It has far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only is related to the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also provide diversified options for the travel of the vast number of residents of Jin-Jin-hei.

<seg id="2">A recent study in Canada found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even billions of plastic microplastic microplastic, significantly higher than one's estimated throughout the year, according to a report. Quantity, but so far there is no evidence that intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers at maggil university in Canada reportedly found that immersing plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag will release about 11600 million plastic particles and 3100 millions of smaller nani plastic particles into the cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50 million plastic particles each year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study was reportedly published in the journal of environmental science and technology, where researchers tested 4 different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafe, opening the tea bags and dip it into almost boiling 5 minutes in the water, then analyzed with electron microscope and spectrometer.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11600 million plastic particles, " several stages higher than the plastic load of other foods</seg>
<seg id="8">Most Tea Bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands made of natural fiber still use plastic to seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some branded tea bags are no longer paper and instead of plastic, which researchers tested.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define the size between 100 nanometers and 5 Millimetres and are mainly produced by decomposition of plastic waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers found microplastics in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, which can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers first found plastic particles in human poop samples from several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to test the potential toxicity of the tea bags release of plastic particles, the Canadian research team put fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affect the behavior of these fleas and cause them to develop deformations.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the world health organization (who), there is no evidence that intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, who noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact it has on humans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers speculate that these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, possibly because these plastic tea bags are in contact with boiling water, even if "Edible Grade" plastic heated to 40 degrees Celsius, they may break down toxic substances.</seg>

<seg id="1">The State-owned investment transfer enriching social security fund - starting from the starting point of " enriching social security fund money bag the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, the writer believes that this is not a simple " physical shift " of equity, but the " Mathematical addition</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 20, the ministry of finance, ministry of human and social affairs, the state affairs commission, the administration of taxation and the sfc jointly issued the circular on the full push of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the social security fund. The Fund schedule, the central and local transfer of parts of State-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, was fully rolled in 2019</seg>
<seg id="4">After the documents were released, departments such as the ministry of finance were implemented quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 25, the ministry of finance transferred 10 % of the shares of icbc and agricultural bank to the social security fund, with a total value of over 115000 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the regulations, the social security foundation and other undertakings as financial investors, enjoy the right to gain, disposition and the right to be informed of State-owned shares.</seg>
<seg id="7">Icbc and agriculture bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in its holding shareholders and actual controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this regard, the writer believes that similar state-owned equity transfer is not a simple change to ownership, but a "addition operation" that can inspire a series of effects.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first step of the "added result" of the transfer of some state capitals to social security, naturally can embody the national ownership of State-owned enterprises and the development results shared by all.</seg>
<seg id="10">After years of reform and development, State-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy, with strong profitability and stable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, the leading companies are constantly realizing the best and bigger and stronger.</seg>
<seg id="12">On July 10, the State Council's standing meeting decided that this year, it will launch the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the social security fund.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ministry of finance immediately said, in collaboration with the relevant departments, according to the deployment of the state council general meeting, it will make a comprehensive push to some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic pension system and the development outcome of State-owned enterprises</seg>
<seg id="14">The second step of "added results" is to enhance the sustainability of our country's social security fund and further strengthen the foundation of old-Age Social Security System.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the population aging, our country's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national capital, as the subject of the transfer, have the ability to continue profitability and dividends effectively replenish the social security fund, but also provide the source of the social security fund.</seg>
<seg id="16">Estimates Show that every 3.8 percent of State-owned capital can support a reduction in the deposit ratio of basic pension insurance for enterprises by 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third step of the "added result" is adding stabilizer to capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="18">The way of this transfer to receive benefits is " dividends, and operate as auxiliary</seg>
<seg id="19">The Social Security Fund, as financial investors in state-owned capital, really focuses on dividends.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the social security fund, as value investors in the capital market, has strong capital operational capacity.</seg>
<seg id="21">For listed assets in state-owned capital, social security fund participation in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which will help improve the business level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the social security fund, as an investment vane, the increase in its stake, helps to further strengthen its influence in the market and play a "Stabilizer" in the market.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it also helps to fully utilize the "Value Discovery" function of agency investors, and guide investors to invest rational and value investment.</seg>
