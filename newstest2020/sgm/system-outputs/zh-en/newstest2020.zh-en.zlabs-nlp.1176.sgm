<seg id="1">The women are expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!</seg>
<seg id="2">On 27 July, in a match against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was wrenched back to a city by their opponents, winning three to one lek in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="3">The World Cup was nearing its end, but the Chinese women's platoon could not be taken lightly in the face of Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the first two tournaments with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoon performed as strong as ever, with two cities under 25:19, 25:16, until the third tournament, where the team suffered setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dutch women's platoon, who had fallen behind, strengthened their bowling, and the Chinese squad was hit by a legend, along with the girls' attacks, and the mistakes began to increase, eventually being wrenched back to a city at 21:25 by their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an interview, he also stated: "Third, because we're wrong, we're sending about 8 points."</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the Dutch women's volleyball was not underestimated, and the Chinese women's platoon was prepared to be difficult, and although it was lost, everything was still in the hands of Lang Ping, "It was normal for the strong to win and the five tournaments, so we said to the team members to be focused on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">In the fourth episode, the team members actively adjusted their position, and Zhang Changning was able to get eight points from the attacking end, making a great deal of success for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">To date, only two rounds of the eleven rivalry have been left, and the Chinese women's platoon, although one hand has been touching the championship, did sound the alarm bell to the Chinese women in the match against the Dutch team: the more critical the moment, the more it will be.</seg>
<seg id="10">In another match on 27th, Russian and American women finished five, and the U.S. team failed to take three-thirds of their opponents, so that the Chinese women's platoon could be crowned in an earlier round if they did three-thirds of the race against Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="11">The situation is evolving in favour of Chinese women.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, although the Serbian team had so many major players, this did not mean that they could easily deliver three to the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="13">In its current form, the Serbian team had virtually no medals, which meant that they could "lightly load" against the Chinese women's platoon, lay down the burden to fully shock their opponents, and the Chinese team was under pressure to win the championship, and the situation could fluctuate.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the replacement Serbian team was not a "cut-down" of lambs, and in previous battles with the Netherlands, both sides were in the 5th of the war, and the Serbian 2nd team was able to reverse the Dutch overall thickness, as shown by the depth of its thickness.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before the start of the third stage of the race, Rang Ping also said that both teams would not fight against him: "The race in Osaka would be very difficult, and we would have to prepare carefully as we have done in the past."</seg>
<seg id="16">Today, the coronation's corners have been blown up, and the race has actually entered the "white heat phase".</seg>
<seg id="17">In realism, the Chinese women's platoon is above their opponents, but only at the last critical juncture, and it is also up to the women's platoon to be able to achieve their normal level and to release themselves from the tournament.</seg>

<seg id="2">On 27 July, a kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage classification education course that taught young children to identify recyclable and other types of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is known that this is the first time that waste is classified into local early childhood education classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously, nine departments of the province of Jilin jointly issued the Jilin Programme of Work to Promote the Classification of Urban Living Waste in the province.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2019, on the basis of a pilot project on the compulsory classification of garbage in Changchun, the province decided to work on the classification of garbage in local cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city of Jilin is one of these.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is our hope that this event will lead to a family-led by young children, a kindergarten-led society and the promotion of the concept of environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hi Fan International Kindergarten Executive Director Liu Juan said.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the same day, the gardener read out an environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage would be classified from the child.</seg>
<seg id="10">After performing "Lower Carbon Bebles" dance, the children made garbage-classified small games.</seg>
<seg id="11">The instructor also issued "recoverable" "other garbage" labels, advising the children to stick to the garbage bucket and record small videos when they returned home.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liu explained that the kindergarten had been promoting low-carbon, green environmental concepts and regularly opened environmental lecture halls.</seg>
<seg id="13">The garbage disposal sites in the gardens have also been equipped with barrels that can be classified, and the types of garbage are indicated above.</seg>
<seg id="14">Teachers teach children what is recyclable goose</seg>

<seg id="1">Shirk's long-standing political legacy</seg>
<seg id="2">On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died at the age of 86.</seg>
<seg id="3">The great political legacy of the French politician, who was in power that year, still deserved our praise as the world was in the midst of a century-old coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chirac had served as President of France for 12 years in a very charismatic manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism and his strong support for European integration, representing the pursuit of "European Dreams".</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he strongly advocated multipolarization and multilateralism in the world and was a strategically visible politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">For this reason, the French press described him as "a prominent representative of France on the world stage".</seg>
<seg id="8">One of Chirac's political judgments was against the American-dominated war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under his leadership, France joined with Germany to clamp down on U.S. pressure and was in the forefront of the anti-war campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">A year after the outbreak of war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and would make the world more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="11">Later facts proved that Chirac's warning was very correct.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the wake of European integration and the growing rise in the unilateralism of the United States, Chirac has no doubt been very instructive for strategic thinking and choices in international political and global affairs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chirac was also a French politician who had become familiar and cordial to the Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was one of the promoters and creators of the "Golden Decade" of the Chinese-French relationship, and when he was first elected President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of the Chinese-French relationship with the strategic vision of politicians.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2004, a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France was established, and bilateral contacts between China and France entered an entirely new phase.</seg>
<seg id="16">During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields, including aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made groundbreaking progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chirac initiative, the Year of Chinese and French Culture, created a new cultural exchange model in the history of Chinese and French.</seg>
<seg id="18">Chirac was particularly impressive about Chinese culture throughout his lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to his Chinese diplomat, Chirac was able to carry some poems from Li Bai and Duff, and even accurately judged the history of the Chinese bronze apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Do not see the pyramid as actually going to Egypt, and not the Qin-chan is not really going to China"—the gold sentence comes from Chirac.</seg>
<seg id="21">Shilak, who received a special visit from Xinhua News Agency reporters, said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems associated with China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.</seg>
<seg id="22">But I personally have confidence in China.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization and that its experience has been sufficient to help it to establish ideas and values for harmonious development, and to assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="24">I also believe that China's renaissance will bring new and creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Spaniards have gone, but the political legacy and revelations of Chirac to the world will survive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR have joined forces to oppose the bill</seg>
<seg id="2">Some members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR issued a 27-day joint statement expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019" by the Foreign Committees of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="3">This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the status of a free trade port and a separate customs area, the economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports fields, and the "Hong Kong, China" to enter into business, cooperation and development relations with various countries and regions of the world, and to conclude and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements.</seg>
<seg id="4">These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislative body.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, and has worked with different countries and regions to engage in cooperation in a number of relevant fields.</seg>
<seg id="6">The statement stated that the U.S. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee was not necessary to pass the relevant bill, but only to respond to the call of its harbour agent as a means of gross interference in the internal affairs of Hong Kong and of securing political rhetoric for its agents in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="7">The members of the group deplored this move and strongly opposed it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement stated that Hong Kong was an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surpluses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, a fair and free business environment, and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The passage of the bill by the United States, in addition to fighting Hong Kong and the United States' own interests, would aggravate relations between China and the United States without any benefit or prejudice to others.</seg>
<seg id="11">The declaration stated that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy the rights conferred on it by the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations as it had done in the past and with unwavering implementation of the "one country, two systems" approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to The European Times, the reform of the immigration policy will be discussed next week in both chambers of the French Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="2">French President Marcron had recently claimed that France could not "adopt everyone", but at the same time sought to "adopt it properly".</seg>
<seg id="3">Marcron was reported to have attempted to find a compromise route in immigration matters to slow the impending debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a recent interview with the General Assembly during its general debate in New York, Marcron expressed the hope that there would be a genuine "two-pronged" solution to migration policy, striking a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="5">Marcron said, "If France wishes to be properly admitted (migrants), it will not be able to accept everyone."</seg>
<seg id="6">Marcron identified four priorities of his immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of persons who had entered France illegally and who were not in a position to stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Health Assistance (AME) system was the most widely discussed issue in the past.</seg>
<seg id="8">Marcron said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but not to cancel it, but to limit it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following Marcron's speech, the far-right leader of the National League, Le Pon, tweeted that Marcron's statement was "hollow talk".</seg>
<seg id="10">Rashel, a member of the right-wing Republican Party and President of the Senate, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a way that was "faced with reality" but "faced with reality" and indirectly criticized Marcron.</seg>
<seg id="11">Left-Socialist Congressman Vallau said that France should "adopt more and better" with regard to immigration, and criticized Marcron's "cooling" issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was reported that a new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which had been enacted for one year, had led to disagreements within the ruling party but had not been able to reassure the right-wing opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the next 2022 general election, the subject of immigration policy would again be the focus of far right-wing attacks, and Marcron would need to make a difference on the issue, but would also run the risk of furying left-wing members within the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was reported that immigration policy would be debated in the lower chamber of the French National Assembly on 30 September and in the Senate on 2 October.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are indications that China's A Unit is in the process of "camping back" and that many listed companies have taken "real gold and silver" to buy back the company's shares.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the financial data service provider's Eastern Wealth, as of 27 September 2019, the company listed in stock A had repurchase implementation totalling more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, Lower RMB), well above the figures for the same period in previous years, marking a record high in stock repurchasements.</seg>
<seg id="3">In response, Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Macorong Information Consulting Limited, said that the overall low valuation of the A stock market this year, the buy-back of shares at a relatively low price, was beneficial to listed companies for more efficient use of the funds, as well as the willingness of listed companies to proactively manage the market value and the plentiful cash flow situation, and encouraged investor confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, a well-developed stock buy-back system has encouraged listed companies to actively undertake stock buy-backs.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning of this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the implementation of stock repurchase by listed companies, providing detailed stock repurchase rules and guidelines for listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented a buy-back increase programme have concentrated mainly in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics industries.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, six listed companies repurchase more than $1 billion this year, based on the amount paid for the repurchase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first of these was the Ily shares, which were repurchased for more than $5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is the market impact of stock repurchase by listed companies?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Deputy Dean of the School of Finance and Finance of the People's University of China, Zhao Xi Jun, in an interview with a correspondent of the China-New Society, stated that the repurchase indicated, on the one hand, that the listed company had a stronger economic power and a better financial position and was able to maintain stability in equity prices and give investors confidence, and, on the other hand, that the listed company and its shareholders were responsible to the company, to the market and to the investor.</seg>
<seg id="11">The former is based on the company's good business performance, while the latter requires a higher quality of listed companies and their holding shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="12">For capital markets, this is the most core underlying element.</seg>
<seg id="13">The buy-back of shares by listed companies helps to boost investor confidence and supports the stock prices of listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the Eastern Securities Study, the increase in stock purchases for stock market A this year is expected to exceed $15 billion, based on the expected stock buy-backs set by the company listed in stock A as a whole since the beginning of the year, as well as the average stock buy-backs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nearly two months later, the restoration of a large posthumous mural of the Tianjin Tianjin Palace by the State-focused cultural protection unit was completed on 26 days and will be reopened during this year's National Day.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Grave of the Sacred Saints is a large-scale traditional fresco that fully reflects the life of the mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was created from 1991 to 1994 by the former head of the Tianjin City Museum of Folklore (the Palace of the Heavens), with the approval of the State authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is known that the mural was painted on the walls of the palace south and north of the palace, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres high, in two parts, with more than 30 stories of birth and descent, sea crossing and feathering, and 358 characters re-emerging their mother's life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Changkwei Tsai reported that in recent years, Tianjin had rained in the summer and dry in the winter, resulting in a "humid dry" fresco, which accounted for 60% of the total fresco area.</seg>

<seg id="7">The restoration work was led by Changkwei Tsai, who invited four prominent national painters to join.</seg>
<seg id="8">The restoration work was based on the principle of 'preserving as old', while the original murals were partially adapted, and the murals were repaired in less perfect places.</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 25, the Beijing Daxing International Airport was inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2">The "Phoenix wing" of the Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal is known as the first of the "seven miracles of the New World".</seg>
<seg id="3">At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, with 100 million+ passengers carried over the past year, becoming the second airport in the world to cross billions of passengers after Atlanta Airport in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that by 2022, 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights will be through the Beijing Daxing International Airport; by 2025, 72 million passengers will be through, and 30 per cent will be on international flights.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the "New Gate", how hard is it to be?</seg>
<seg id="6">The Beijing Daxing International Airport, located between the Daxing District of Beijing and the Guangyang District of Gangwang, Hebei Province, is 46 km from the Tiananmenmen line and is the largest newly built airport in the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ground floor of the roof of the terminal was projected at 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="8">Beijing Daxing International Airport is the first terminal in the world to have two arrival floors and two departure floors—F1-F4 international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures, and international departures.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-storey bridge outside the terminal connects the high speed and the airport, corresponding to the terminal F3 and F4 respectively—international departure to the floor and domestic departure to both floors.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Beijing Daxing International Airport's first flight opened the era of Beijing's Twin Airports.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new airport has been designated as a major international air terminal, the development of a new power source for the country, and the Jinjin-Hai regional integrated transport hub, which supports the construction of the Xiao'an New Area. To date, 66 airlines are interested in entering Daxing International Airport in Beijing, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong Macau and foreign airlines, and airline flights continue to be approved.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the winter and spring of 2019, the Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, 101 domestic and 15 international, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international destinations.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was coordinated with the Beijing Capital International Airport (Beijing-Capital International Airport) to develop a well-competitive, internationally competitive "twin hubs" airport pattern, which relieved the capital airport's saturated capacity and better served the rapidly growing need for air transport in and around Beijing, effectively increasing the international competitiveness of our national aviation industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to ensure efficiency and quality, the Beijing Daxing International Airport took due account of its geographical location, the airfield's relationship with the surrounding airspace and operating environment, and the airport runways adopted a "full-direction" layout for the first time in the country, using the world's largest automated air-barrel system, establishing China's largest terminal control area and maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the first time, nationalized automated baggage processing and information management systems were used at airports of this size in the country, and innovative baggage transport modes were introduced to improve baggage processing efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Beijing Daxing International Airport was the first airline to fly the Phoenix's wings.</seg>
<seg id="17">It created more than 40 new international and national airports with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, with direct and indirect economic impacts on industry in the surrounding areas, and breathing life into economic development in Beijing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wang Burxiang, Secretary-General of Shandong Bonghuang County County – Yangtong County Fu Min-Heart-Sinhua Network</seg>
<seg id="2">Wang Burxiang, a Shandong Shou Guangman, born in February 1943, joined the service in 1967 and served as the township party secretary, county secretary, mayor, etc.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 1986, Wang Boxiang served as the county secretary of Shandong Province, where he was a poor county in Weifang.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the five years of his tenure, Wang Bo was happy and focused on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing a salt beach for the north; and laying the foundations for industry, from which the bags and cashew plates were raised.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is a tradition of breeding and lessons learned from breeding.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early 1980s, living farmers were not able to sell their vegetable harvests and were left in the ground.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wang Boxiang's research found that the key to grabbing vegetables was to be in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The longevity began with the creation of a wholesale market for vegetables and opened the stage for the development of a market economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The party's cadre was spearheaded and smashed, and the county was in charge of all losses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 1989, with the support of Wang Pexiang, 17 members of the party, including King Leyi of Sanyuan Zhu Village, set up 17 warming vegetable huts, and 17 "billion yuan households" in the village that year.</seg>
<seg id="11">An extension team was then set up in the county, and with the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Lei visited the townships; more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds then spread across the county and across the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">For centuries, 1.6 million acres of land besides salt beaches have been painted on shallow beaches.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local masses live in great hardship.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sonan has a large vegetable hut, and Songhorn?</seg>
<seg id="15">Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to fight for the General Assembly, and set up a camp on the beach for four or fifty days.</seg>
<seg id="16">Wang Boxiang and the county's leadership cadres were eaten on the site, bagged on the same car as civilian labourers, restaurant, and the population saw them all stretched the thumb and beat their eyes ... At that time, Shōnai developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed the "Pubel Basin" on the salt-base.</seg>
<seg id="17">In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang City Industrial Conference as County Secretary for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the conference, a "Comparative Table of Industrial Economic Figures for the Twelve Districts of Weifang City" was released, and the gross industrial product (GIP) was good at first glance and ranked fourth.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the salt is taken away, however, the pure industrial output of the luminous industry is only 119 million yuan, the third in the penultimate.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wang Boxiang, with more than 70 men, ran to the field for "brain bands".</seg>
<seg id="21">Less than a year later, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every year thereafter, "Take the Legion" is organized to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a shortage of businesses and even fewer entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="24">Wang Boxiang presided over a special session shootboard: 40 "career-minded people" were selected and pushed to the industry line by public selection of factory managers throughout the county.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 1991, Shou Guang entered the country's Hundred Hills County, and Wang Boxiang was appointed deputy mayor of Weifang City.</seg>
<seg id="26">He left over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, and 4,854 businesses, more than 100,000 "million-dollar households", a cadre recognized by the population, whose people still cordially referred to him as "Our Secretary of the Pexiang".</seg>

<seg id="1">On 26 September, the Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2">The meeting was attended by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d'Ivoire, currently a member of the Security Council in Africa; Oyono, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea; Pandor, Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa; Kara, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Niger; and Jessinawi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wang Yi made four proposals for strengthening cooperation between the Central African parties in the Council.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The greatest challenge in the current international situation was unilateralism, the direct consequence of which was the challenge to the basic norms of international relations and the impact on the role of the United Nations to the detriment of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries in general, including African countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">To meet this challenge, we need to unite and shoulder in order to be strong.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just three votes but the entire African continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Together, China and Africa are not just four votes, but will lead other countries to follow up, influence and shape the Council's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a "3+1" coordination mechanism, which must be fully utilized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Secondly, there is consultation to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="11">China has always advocated political solutions to hot spots, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the complex challenges on the Council's agenda, particularly the hotspots in Africa, are mostly the root of the scourge of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Together, we want to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.</seg>
<seg id="14">Third, self-reliance.</seg>
<seg id="15">African countries and peoples are best aware of Africa's problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">In dealing with African hotspots, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau "Population collapsed", and he was also able to be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id="2">This time, Trudeau stumbled off a "great crater" that Trudeau had dug himself.</seg>
<seg id="3">In recent days, Canadian media have come to light with the old photographs of current Prime Minister Trudeau, who portrayed himself as black.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was seen as an obvious act of racial discrimination, which caused a great upsurge in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the Canadian population did not buy the money.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trudeau would have pulled stones and smashed his feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">As noted by political commentators Leigh and others, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party (FLP) have been highly accusing opposition parties or dissenting members of their party of "big losses" in this regard since the rise of the anti-black-face movement in the United States, and have repeatedly threatened that "no matter who commits this error should be summarily dismissed".</seg>
<seg id="9">Simply put, this time, Trudeau stumbled off the "great crater" from which Trudeau himself excavated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trudeau was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man who had blown off a "political idol" cyclone.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was originally a "politician" and succeeded the Federal Liberal Party in an unexpected and beautiful war in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections, when the Federal Liberal Party was half-represented in the lower house of the Federation, gaining valuable separate cabinet power.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, Trudeau put forward a number of deaf-minded political platforms, ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality" "eco-environment" and "economic revival", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "uncorrective winds".</seg>
<seg id="13">However, for five years he has been in power, in almost all of the above-mentioned areas, "highly low".</seg>
<seg id="14">The issue of "ethnicity and gender equality" was left aside from the "black face" event, which had led to a series of "honourless" issues relating to Aboriginal people, which had led Aboriginal groups and chiefs to move protest tents to the gates of Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's statehood.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the fight against corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in a boiling "Lanvangelings incident".</seg>
<seg id="16">It was exposed to serious irregularities in favouritism by the "Langwangling" construction and engineering company in his home country, and pressure was put on the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation, who were asked to "highly raise your nobility".</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Trudeau moved to the officer who revealed the fraud after the troubleshot—the previously mentioned Wang Chuadi, who was the Attorney General of Canada when he was the first to disclose the fraud and to handle the case directly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the case itself has doubts, its suspicion is difficult to dissipate.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many observers noted that Trudeau's five-year-old administration had collapsed, mainly as a result of his own "pits", while the largest "pits" were no more than the "tiger snake tail" and the "self-eating fruit" than the "lawyer".</seg>
<seg id="20">Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data show that the number of respondents in support of Trudeau has fallen from over 60% to over 30% from 2015 to the present, while the number of opponents has soared from less than 30% to over 60%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the performance of other opposition parties and their party leaders was equally poor, even a significant number of voters who were still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party now did not think of the Federal Chancellor, the head of the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="22">On October 21, a new Canadian federal legislative election was about to begin, and would Trudeau be able to repeat the winning series five years ago?</seg>
<seg id="23">The answer may be one word: difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Both at the level of enterprise competition, at the level of consumer experience, and at the level of regional aviation integration and Beijing's desire to develop integration are far-reaching and positive.</seg>
<seg id="2">On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Xinjing newspaper reporter was informed by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Transformation that the capital airport was already in a state of super-saturated operation and that the opening of the Daxing International Airport would enhance air service capacity in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city to have two airports in the same city, similar to the Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which mainly serves domestic air services, and Pudong Airport, which will be based primarily on international airlines, and the future capital airport and Daxing Airport, which will provide more disaggregated services for different national and international air operations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Daxing Airport is more beneficial to the capital airport from the point of view of its operational development.</seg>
<seg id="6">The capital airport reached 100 million passengers in 2018 and was the highest in the country, but there was still a significant power gap compared to the rapidly growing operational requirements, especially for international routes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for travel, travel and other purposes, and in keeping with the urban trends of Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected cities, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million passengers per year and 4 million tons of cargo and mail throughput.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, there is no overlap in the positioning of the two airports, each targeting different customer groups, and there is sufficient market space.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the economic level, it is clear that navigation at Daxing International Airport would have a win-win effect, easing air traffic tensions in Beijing, accelerating the increase in passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake run by Air Capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">From a user's point of view, with the opening of the international airport, it is not necessary to concentrate all future travels at the capital airport, but it can also reduce the range of problems associated with over-concentration, such as longer terminal security times, slower passenger boarding, an indirect increase in aircraft and passengers staying at the airport, an increase in the burden of airport operations, and a reduction in shipping through the capital airport, which has also improved passenger travel experience.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to media measurements of the time and cost of various routes to major international airports, such as the high speed of the Beijing–Daxing airport directly from the South Five Rings, the journey can take 50 minutes and the oil will return around 40 yuan and the high speed will cost 15 yuan, while the railroad line Daxing Airport will be selected at a distance of 20 km and 30 km, at a fare of 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan; citizens may also travel between Beijing and Daxing Airport for more than 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, there are a wide range of transport options available to citizens to travel to Daxing Airport, and within a reasonable range of costs and time.</seg>
<seg id="13">From the point of view of trends, Daxing's airport is located at the Beijing Jinjin Jingjin transport hub and is thus far from the city of Beijing, but increased radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, which is of great importance to the economic development of Lazing North and Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin have access to more international airline services at Daxing International Airport, as seen in the traffic plans of the airport.</seg>
<seg id="15">Daxing Airport's transport facilities are well-developed, and in addition to the new airport line at Daxing Airport in the Beijing metropolitan area, there are several highways connected to and around Daxing Airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Guangdong Guanguan, Foshan and Qingyuan city passengers can travel to Baiyun Airport in Guangdong by highways such as Guangdong, Guangdong and Guangdong, the residents of the Beijing perimeter gallery and the Xinxin district will benefit from easy and efficient air services.</seg>
<seg id="17">As can be seen from this, it is not only the addition of several runways and aircraft at Daxing International Airport, but also the far-reaching and positive implications of business competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the development of regional air integration, the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, the diversification of options for the travel of a large number of residents in Beijing, the further improvement of the quality of shipping services in Beijing, and the promotion of the integrated development process in Jinjin and the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, for navigation at the airport, we have to account not only for individual tips but also for overall development.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Vietnamese Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Shengzhou Huanhua Province</seg>
<seg id="2">The Deputy Director of the Economic Commission of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen de Tianh, revealed that early this year Viet Nam's economic and social development had seen many new developments and continued to grow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Forum, the participants held an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes: economic development in 2019 and the impact of the partial self-trade agreement; some salient issues of the Vietnamese economy in 2019; salient issues of Vietnamese social culture in 2019; and forecasts and recommendations for Viet Nam's economic and social development in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was general agreement that global economic growth had slowed in the first months of 2019 and that risks and challenges had increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trade friction among large economies has further shrunk global trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that despite the uncertainty in the global economy and the stagnation of growth in 70 per cent of the world's economy, Viet Nam's economic development had achieved many welcome achievements, macroeconomic stabilization, effective inflation control and average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in almost three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, although it was below 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase is still relatively high compared to the same period in the period 2011-2017.</seg>
<seg id="9">In anticipation of Viet Nam's economic development trends for the period 2019-2020, the Deputy Director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Projections of Viet Nam, Dund Young, stated that the Vietnamese economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="10">By 2020, Viet Nam's macroeconomic stability is expected to remain largely stable, the implementation of the self-trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Viet Nam's external export activities will show a downward trend as a result of trade friction.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was therefore necessary to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, proactively search for trade relief measures for goods exported by Viet Nam, explore opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and water products.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, inflation has been kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ten Years of Shinhua Network to witness Digital China in Yunshu Township</seg>
<seg id="2">With the 2009 local website forum as its starting point, the 2019 Yun Habitat Conference in Hangzhou was held for a whole decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the concept of a "cloud fog" to the practice of "top cloud", big data and cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over a period of 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">A new "co-worker" with the artificial intelligence of Aliyun was recently added to the body of the prototype examiner at the Jungtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Hainin, Zhejiang.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is 24 hours unabated, is more than twice as fast as manual and has a qualitative accuracy rate stable at over 95 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the head of the company, the "quality examiner" with a camera had concentrated on more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the cloud-based calculations behind it, it was able to rapidly convert infrared images into binary languages and classify flawed batteries.</seg>
<seg id="7">This enterprise is only a shadow of today's cloud computing aid manufacturing transformation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a Guide to Enabling Enterprises on Cloud Implementation (2018-2020), which aims to achieve a significant increase in corporate cloud awareness and motivation, as well as a significant increase in cloud proportions and application depth by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">The founder of Aliyun, King, insisted that today, data for central cloud computing has opened a bridge to the digital economy where data are a key element.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, our cloud computing industry has been expanding over the past 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The White Paper on the Development of Cloud Computing (2019) released by the China Institute of Information and Communications last July shows that the total market size of cloud computing in China was 96,280 million yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to becoming the key technology underpinning the transformation of the industry and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has altered urban governance and social life through ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="13">This year, the "City Brain", which was debuted for the third consecutive year at the Conference, remains of concern.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Aliyun, the urban brain has now become a hub for urban management from the means of transport governance, and collaborative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through camera head perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain, through its strong ability to calculate, allows for "paid parking first" and "real-time perception of the number of visits" and new urban management services such as "tourist route design".</seg>
<seg id="16">In the area of government services, "one cloud" is used to connect "one thing" and "hands up" is promoted in concert, and cloud computing facilitates the supply of government services to both ends.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, Zhejiang has established a unified public data platform throughout the province through the government cloud.</seg>
<seg id="18">As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, bringing together 1,908 million data in the 3066 category of governance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Zhejiang government departments have made an average of 12 million monthly calls and shared data, and every time the data moves on the 'cloud' may mean that people are running their legs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steep plastic tea bubble tea!</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the Central Society, a recent Canadian study found that plastic tea bags could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the number of microplastics consumed by one person as a whole, but there is no evidence to date that plastic particles ingestion could pose a threat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers at the University of Maggill, Canada, reportedly found that plastic tea bags were leached into an almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius) and that the tea bags released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanometer plastic particles into the cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is significantly higher than the number of microplastics that a person has taken throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to studies published earlier in 2019, people eat at least 50,000 plastic particles per year and inhaled the same amount of microplastics.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in the Mont Lou Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, cleaned the bag into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analysed with electronic microscopes and spectroscopes.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to this study, they found that the single tea bag had released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "a number several degrees higher than the plastic load of other foods."</seg>
<seg id="8">Most tea bags were reported to be made of natural fibres, but many branded as tea bags using natural fibres still used plastics to seal them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based and instead use plastics, which are the subject of tests by researchers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plastic particles are small fragments of plastics, which researchers define as plastic sizes ranging from 100 nm to 5 cm, mainly produced by plastic garbage decomposition.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers have found plastic particles in air, soils, rivers and the deepest trenches around the world, as well as in piped water, bottled water, seafood and beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human faeces samples in several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from the tea bag, the Canadian study team placed Daphnia magna in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of Daphnia magna and caused them to develop malformations.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that plastic particles ingestion would pose a threat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what their effects on humans were.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers hypothesized that these tea bags emit a large amount of plastic particles, possibly due to their exposure to boiling water, and that they may disintegrate or seep toxic substances even if they are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius by "food-grade" plastics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Guterres said that the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.</seg>
<seg id="2">There, a natural disaster could erode the development gains of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have hit Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">About one quarter of the people in small island developing States live at 5 metres or less above sea level.</seg>
<seg id="5">The relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and may even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this week's Climate Action Summit, small island States are working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 so that they can once again lead the world in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guterres said: "The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old injustices.</seg>
<seg id="8">While small island developing States have contributed little to global warming, they have paid the highest price.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a result of their middle-income status, many countries are still trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">The world must act, and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."</seg>
<seg id="11">Today's High-level Meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, especially middle-income countries with high levels of indebtedness, receive funding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline -- the oceans.</seg>
<seg id="13">The latest special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued this week confirms that the oceans have suffered the "crossing" consequences of the climate crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the middle of this century, extreme sea-level rise may occur in many areas every year only once in the first century.</seg>
<seg id="15">The report warned that some island countries would likely become uninhabitable without substantial investment in adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are heavily dependent on external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some States are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Guterres said: "The problem can be solved anywhere by solving it in the most challenging environment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be drawn upon worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="24">He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id="25">They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The over-age peasant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.</seg>
<seg id="2">What are the young workers now?</seg>
<seg id="3">There is no way to use so many 'young people' on the site.</seg>
<seg id="4">In recent days, the Zoukou, who worked as an engineering contractor in the construction industry, has lamented the phenomenon of over-age peasant workers (over retirement age) on the site.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent times, the pencil's higher schools have been carrying out rain-contaminated projects, and there have been a number of rural workers in the campus, and it has been observed that there are many over-age farmers in the campus.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over-age peasant out-workers are not "inactive", but because they are "not leisure" and have the heinous and hard work they have to "be so" — whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems or help their children — and they continue to work hard and hard for the elderly, who are supposed to "left".</seg>
<seg id="7">The "Elderly Active Life" of over-age peasant workers is not as easy as we imagine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Parenting women, supporting the elderly, reading children, helping children to build a building to buy cars, helping children to start their own businesses, and raising their grandchildren between generations, when these peasant labourers have completed their "life tasks" and the bags have been empty, and there are many debts, most of which are lacking in wealth accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order not to drag their children and to save some of their wealth, many rural workers insisted that they "dry until they do it".</seg>
<seg id="10">Many "80 post-80" and even "00 post-00" new-generation peasant labourers are reluctant to work in hard-won secondary industries or low-end services, resulting in structural "working waste", which provides opportunities for over-age peasant labourers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to lack of skills and reduced physical and labour capacity, many over-age farmers work in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a day in which the survival of over-age peasant labourers who are "inaccessible" cannot be ignored and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to their "self-savement" and the public sector's system of blessing and human care, the problem of unpaid wages and wages is addressed by improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour incomes, and improving the survival of over-age rural workers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scholars have pointed out that over-age peasant workers are less likely to rely on home-based solutions to their old-age and medical problems, and that they must support their families through other means.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understanding the "inaccessibility" and strength of over-age farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Looking at the shadows of over-age peasant workers, hearing their lamentation, looking for ways to get them back to the countryside to be truly "reliant in old age", and the need for the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in the virtuous interaction, and the need for multiple synergies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chemetsov said that Russia would not export such a system for the next five years, as "the supply of its own army was first to be supplied and export production would not take place thereafter".</seg>
<seg id="2">This practice is fully consistent with international practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">The major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs first before processing export orders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier, General Yuri Glekhov, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the system was about to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The S-500 system was developed by the "Goldstone-Ante" air defense Cantzern.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that employs working principles for the destruction of ballistic and aerodynamic objectives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main role of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, according to some information, the S-500 could destroy high-speed ultrasound cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed ultrasound missiles more than five times the sound speed, and even near-space targets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Such weapons can also be integrated with other air defence systems, especially the S-400 system, which is important from a national defence perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sergei Chemetsov expressed particular concern about the S-400.</seg>
<seg id="11">The system, he said, was currently in great demand in the world, but it was also needed by the Russian military, including in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The S-400 air defence system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to 15 September, the conversion of the Newlying Island Arctic Air Defense Regiment to the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely within the context of the transition plan to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Russian Northern Fleet News Service, "As the transition to the new S-400 anti-aircraft system progressed, there was a significant increase in the controlled airspace in the Arctic".</seg>
<seg id="17">It is very important that the military assess the successful use of the system in the Far North and Arctic regions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Air Defence Corps officers and soldiers trained in the new system and prepared for combat duty.</seg>
<seg id="19">Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defence system, it is still partially retained.</seg>
<seg id="20">Air defence systems must have weapons capable of destroying various air targets, be they high-speed outer-altitude flight targets or "fish of leaks" close to protected facilities.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by "Gold Diamond-Ante" air defense Concheon, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air attack weapons.</seg>
<seg id="22">The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down a ballistic target of 4.8 km/s at a distance of 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia never concealed that it would deploy additional air defences in the far north to ensure the airspace of the northern sea route.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor" - M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an anti-aircraft battalion to strengthen the anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Russian Ministry of Defence then stated that the Arctic "Tor" forces would be extended to a full brigade.</seg>
<seg id="26">Together with the new S-400 long-range system deployed on New Island and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are powerful in defending Russia's polar sky.</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to the Russian government, the flagship shop would serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding a complex and lengthy process of opening their own shops.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian Multi-Productory Company, a Russian shop operator, focused on the sale of Russian merchandise in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russian merchants have online shops on China's largest trading platforms, including small cats, JD, 1688 , Pinduoduo, hand Q (ShouQ), multi-functional instant messaging software (Wechat), and have their own online platform, Epinduo.com, and Russian merchandise retail chains.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Russian Export Centre will work with Russian stores to develop marketing strategies and standards for participation and screen virtual sheltered product enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shop is scheduled to open and install products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information from the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month to the Chinese Electrical Power Platform is as high as 1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and surpassed $1 billion in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="8">At present, the Alibaba Group will also operate pilot stores for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new shop will include merchandise from businesses selling at least 500 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, my expectations are higher and the sales of 500 million roubles are not yet sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, which are considered high quality and green and environmentally friendly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Kozhevnikov said that competition from Chinese consumers struggling for high purchasing power was intense and increasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said, "We're ambitious in our goal, and 500 businesses were launched through this shop within three years."</seg>
<seg id="14">The platform also hosts the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the University of the Economy of Plekhanov, Russia, said: "This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a state-owned and not a private institution."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I didn't see a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market."</seg>
<seg id="17">He believed that the project would probably not really be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Russian news agency, Andrey Slepnev, the president of the Russian export centre, stated during the Oriental Economic Forum that information on the products of more than 170 Russian enterprises had been published on the largest international wholesale-line platform, Alibaba.com, which could be purchased in China and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of the Tubao, the first of which was held in July this year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises participating in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000-meter pavilion, which will also serve as a centre for the organization of commercial project activities, signing of agreements, presentation sessions and meetings with representatives of Chinese enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some 50 applications from Russian agricultural enterprises have been received.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre stated that "in addition to the agricultural stands, we must hold business meetings, i.e. arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs".</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is another direction in our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them."</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, the Expo will host a master's course, a cooking competition and a Russian-American food screening conference for the Russian cook "Exploring the Sea Station on the Russian Beauty".</seg>

<seg id="2">The "Internet + Smart Plate" gives you a number of things in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 27 November, Nanjing Smart Transport United Gaudet Maps announced that the nation's first "Internet + Smart Site Site" would officially land in Nanjing, where 54 public transport electronic screens would be brightened, a move that would completely upgrade Nanjing's information services, improve the efficiency of public transport services and the well-being of the population.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the past, the anxiety scene of the car was played at the bus station almost every day.</seg>
<seg id="5">The buses' operating times are difficult to predict, along the bus routes and the location of the vehicles, and the problem of buses' pain spots needs to be resolved, particularly in large cities, long commuting routes and complex traffic conditions at the peak hours of commuting at an early evening, which have made the buses' calibration rate difficult.</seg>
<seg id="6">To this end, Nanjing Smart Transport, in conjunction with the Gauder map, explored new directions for "Internet+Transport" easy-to-people services, and launched the country's first smart service project, "Internet + Smart Site Site".</seg>
<seg id="7">According to information received, the country's first "Internet Plus Smart Site" landed in Nanjing, merged with Gao Degree data and Gao Degree's vehicle's ETA algorithm for projected travel time, and built on the capability of "Bus Smart Site Site Plate plus Electronic Maps" to publish bus routes, public transport forecasts, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through "Internet + Smart Sites", Nanjing citizens not only have easy access to the estimated stop time of the bus, know the real-time location of the bus and a few other stations from the current station, but also have direct access to the road along the route in three colours, Red orange Green, making it possible for all bus routes through the station to be visible in real time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thanks to the "Internet + Smart Site Plate" technology, Nanjing citizens achieved easy and efficient modes of public transport such as "experience querying the position of the bus before leaving the door, time of the station at the time of public transport, time of arrival at the place of destination at the time of public transport".</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on the "Internet + Smart Plate" real-time public transport information, it is possible to select the routes best suited to it, while at the same time maintaining psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of such cars, thus making travel more convenient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xinhua Time Review: Unwavering to better our own path</seg>
<seg id="2">The 27th White Paper on China and the World of the New Era was answered: For 70 years, China's development had been successful, largely because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, had found the correct path of development of Chinese special socialism and had staunchly followed it.</seg>
<seg id="3">China's approach to development is the choice of history and the choice of its people.</seg>
<seg id="4">In recent times, in an environment of weakness and internal distress, a generation of Generic volunteers has sought and followed up on the National Salvation Road.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of imperialism, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, and the presidential system were all contemplated and tested, and the results were impractical."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was not until the Communist Party of China and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path of Chinese identity in practice.</seg>
<seg id="7">This path is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China with the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely on the right path that China can do its business well and become the world's second largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, and can continue to benefit the world through its own development.</seg>
<seg id="9">As noted in the White Paper, this development path in China is consistent with China's national circumstances and is adapted to the requirements of the times and will increasingly show brighter prospects for development as time progresses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Once again, the Chinese people knew how difficult it would be to find a path that was right; the Chinese people cherished that path all the way around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese understand the reasoning behind Nan Orange's &lt;unk&gt;, and understand that it is not necessarily appropriate for others to fit themselves and that it is best to do so.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle of world interest.</seg>
<seg id="13">The "Historical end-of-the-life conclusion" was noticed during the tortuous process leading up to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, the success of the socialist path of China's identity declares the end of the "historical end-of-life conclusion", the collapse of the "Chinese collapse" and the failure of the "socialist defeat".</seg>
<seg id="15">China's success had boosted the confidence of the rich in the developing countries and had expanded the way the developing countries were modernized. It had provided experience and lessons for the countries and peoples of the world who wished to accelerate their development while maintaining their own independence and to follow a path consistent with their national circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="16">The world is rich and varied.</seg>
<seg id="17">China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path of development appropriate to their national circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="18">China will not "import" foreign models, nor "export" Chinese models, but will remain firm in its own path, achieve its own constant development, and strengthen its rule-and-government exchanges with all countries, making its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance and good governance.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Fair Work Commission found that a Goodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old female worker through a text message because he preferred to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, a practice that was strongly criticized as "shameful".</seg>
<seg id="2">The committee stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's Jianbin Wang (English pronunciation Eddie), who had worked at the Wagga Wagga shop for more than 20 years, had treated the employees "very unfairly" and could violate anti-discrimination laws.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had always "want to hype me" because she was not Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairman of the Commission, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang had previously published a number of job advertisements in various Chinese employment forums in Australia".</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "the first Asian woman" and the other said "the first Asian employee".</seg>
<seg id="6">In a third post, he said that he was "more inclined to expatriate (sic) people".</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by means of a text message in April this year, later stating that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged lack of small cash from $5.10 to $30 on silver machines.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Sams, however, said that Mr. Wang's dismissal of Ms. Ayton was weak and unsubstantiated.</seg>
<seg id="9">She has been absent for only one class for three years, and the "missing amount" totals several Australian dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">He states that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "in fact unrelated to her actions or performance".</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: "In my view, the real motive for the dismissal of the defence, supported by the evidence of the job advertisement issued by Mr. Wang, was that he would prefer to hire staff with an Asian background.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions constitute a prima facie violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or unlawful dismissal of the applicant".</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Sams said that it would not be appropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton in view of his "happy" treatment.</seg>
<seg id="14">He should consider the payment of compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker and paid $26 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="15">In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his own rulings and documents to the Committee's head to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.</seg>
<seg id="16">He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the reasons allegedly for her dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said: "I believe that the defendant took an unavoidable, unjust and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and that Mr. Wang "waited" the opportunity, which in his view would 'prove' the validity of the termination of the applicant's employment."</seg>
<seg id="18">"He was wrong ... the defender completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her in dismissing the applicant, and it was shocking that he had acted with disrespect and extreme injustice."</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Sams said that although Goodworks was a small business, "It must be frankly stated that no regular employer would be able to dissolve employees in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said, "This is shameful and extremely unfair."</seg>

<seg id="1">About 800 million trips to China to refract tourism supply and demand</seg>
<seg id="2">About 800 million people will travel to the upcoming 11th Golden Week!</seg>
<seg id="3">Large data from various tourism platforms show that the tourism consumption market in our country is flourishing, both in terms of supply and demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tourist report for the Jubilee Tourist Association foresees that, taking into account tourism statistics from previous years, the number of tourists in the country during the national holiday is expected to be close to 800 million this year, and that more than 7.5 million more tourists will travel abroad.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities are scheduled to travel through the platform, free travel, customized tourism, local play and other products, involving 100 countries and territories.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism Studies, 726 million national tourist arrivals took place during the national holidays last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not only will the number of tourists be re-invented this year, but the increase in consumption will also become the "major melody" of national holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journey reported that the cost per tourist across the country during the National Day holiday was over $3,000, an increase over the same period last year, due to the fact that tourists generally chose better-experienced products, such as high-scoring hotels, shopping-free tourist corps, precision corps, specialist car guides, etc.</seg>
<seg id="9">Similar trends have been reported in the donkey tourist network, where the use of comfortable cars and less than 10-person "private ensembles" is more popular than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tourism data from Spring and Autumn show that consumers prefer experience, service, and "slow from capacity".</seg>
<seg id="11">Pig data show that tourist bookings have grown the fastest in the cities below and in the fourth line, at a rate of 30 per cent above the same rate, and that more people in the country have been refracted to increase their consumption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Personalization is a feature of the 11th Golden Week tour of the year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Data from the journey show that the number of hire cars on the holiday journey is expected to increase by nearly 60% compared to the same number, while short-distance journeys along small crowds routes around the country's jubilee continue to be highly appreciated, and the number of private regiments has increased by 155%.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sharing joy is the main purpose of people's travel and leisure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Data from the journey show that 28% of the tourists in the National Day holiday are relatives, 25% are couples and 23% are friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">In terms of tourist age, "80 post" and "90 post" account for over 50 per cent of the total number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is a matter of concern that, unlike the golden outbound movement, this year's domestic market performance has been more "eye" than ever.</seg>
<seg id="18">Figures from pigs show that the number of people scheduled for national holidays this year has increased by 42 per cent compared with the number of national travel routes, which has increased faster than trips out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="19">Industry analyzes that, while demand is strong, tourism-side reforms are being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer "literary journey".</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, the National Directorate of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently jointly released the "Sporting Precision Line for the 11th Golden Week of 2019"; 7 plates of 100 cultural and tourist events have been launched at the ongoing Shanghai Tourist Festival 2019 to attract Chinese and foreign tourists; and several provinces of Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have introduced downturns or free-of-charge measures.</seg>
<seg id="21">Portable reservation data indicate that the country has the most "fire" destinations with unique natural winds or cultural features, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destinations.</seg>

<seg id="2">Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest age barber certified by the Golden World Records in New York, the United States, never retired for his daily zizzhi, but died of jaw cancer complications in 19 years, denouncing his 96-year-old cut-off.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to CNN, Mancinelli had emigrated to the United States at the age of eight, and had not been able to sweep the floor for too long at a barber shop and had taken a cutter at the age of 12 to serve the guests, thereby reducing the economic pressure on the family.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mancinelli, although attending primary school, did not graduate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Robert, Mancinelli's son, revealed that his father was happy to work and that people from around the world liked him, but that his father was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and was unable to work six weeks before his death due to physical factors, but that was not retired because he was waiting for his painting to go back and cut his hair.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 82, Robert said that after his father's death, he had to find a new barber, as he had helped his father cut his hair during his lifetime.</seg>

<seg id="1">Over 100 billion yuan in annual buy-backs by companies listed in the year to record the New High-Sinhua Network</seg>
<seg id="2">In order to stabilize the company's equity price and preserve the company's image, listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently in the last two years, hoping to pass the message that the company's value is being underestimated to the market through targeted buybacks, pooled bidding transactions, etc., thereby stabilizing equity prices and increasing investor confidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Eastern Wealth Choice data show that the amount spent by the listed company to buy back shares was RMB 7.9 billion in 2017, rising sharply to RMB 51 billion in 2018, and that since 2019, the total amount of buyback implemented by the listed company A has exceeded RMB 100 billion, creating a new high in the historical buy-back of Unit A, well ahead of previous years.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be the same as the increase in the shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject of implementation, the source of funding, the purpose of repurchase, and the equity of the stock itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the Securities Daily reporter, Cheo Yang, Chairman of the Shanghai Macorong Information Consulting Limited, said that the current system of supporting listed companies to buy back shares had been improved in November 2018 in response to problems with the narrower range of stock buybacks, complex decision-making processes, and inadequate inventory systems, and that there had been a significant increase in stock buyback during the year as a result of earlier policy incentives for listed companies to buy back shares.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January of this year, the SEC officially issued the Rules for the Implementation of Repurchase of Interests by Listed Companies. These policies widened the sources of funding for the repurchase of Listed Companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, led to improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of Listed Companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the advice, the listed company undertook stock repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, simpler repurchase processes, and greater interest in stock repurchase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Repurchase of shares in a relatively low position would also allow listed companies to increase the efficiency of the use of the funds, thereby increasing the profitability per share, increasing the net asset return rate and relieving pressure on the company's profit indicators.</seg>
<seg id="9">The interest of listed companies in repurchasing shares is greater than that of large shareholders, and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market value and the abundance of cash flows.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xuyang argued that the undervaluation of stock prices was the main factor in the buy-back of listed companies, which no longer reflected the company's future development prospects, and that such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not be invested blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial reports of such listed companies and their specific operations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Listed companies with large-scale buy-backs show at least their development confidence and financial strength.</seg>
<seg id="12">The rebate enthusiasm of the A-market company has gradually increased and the repurchase has become more common, with data indicating that nearly a thousand listed companies have repurchased their shares this year, and that the leading companies in the various industries have become the main players in the repurchase market.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ping'an, China, has recently disclosed progress in repurchase, stating that the company has cumulatively repurchased shares in A through centralized competitive bidding transactions, accounting for 57.59 million shares, representing 0.315 per cent of the company's total equity, and has paid a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), all of which will be used for employee shareholding schemes, including, but not limited to, long-term service plans that have been considered and adopted by the company's shareholders' assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erie's shares have paid $5,792 million for share buy-backs and has recently been adjusted for the purpose of buy-backs, with the original plan to change the "repurchase stock to be used entirely as a source of equity incentives for later implementation" to "cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which $152 million is used as a source of equity incentives and the remaining 3,049,000 will be written off to reduce registered capital".</seg>
<seg id="15">Erie's shareholding stated that the write-off of a portion of the shares that had been repurchased would allow for a further increase in the level of returns per share and a tangible increase in the return on investment of the company's shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="16">The TCL Group announced on 25 September that it would buy 3.59% of the company's shares, at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="17">The TCL Group Board Office told the Securities Daily reporter that the buyback would be used for employee equity schemes, equity incentives or conversion of company bonds issued by listed companies that could be converted to shares.</seg>
<seg id="18">The TCL Group maintains an established business strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and continuing healthy development.</seg>
<seg id="19">Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of the investor's interests, the company plans to buy back its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other means of financing, taking into account the performance of the company's stock in the second-tier market in the last year and taking into account the company's business and financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">The former HF chief economist, Yang Dron, said that the operations of the listed company to buy back shares, while reducing the number of shares in the market and increasing the interest per share of the listed company, were an important benefit for the second-tier market, and that the willingness of the listed company to take the initiative of pulling out the true silver and repurchasing the stock from the stock market had greatly boosted market confidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">Repurchase by domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, particularly in the case of high-performance shares, and it is a very good way to boost investor confidence through stock repurchase. It is also a positive and encouraging practice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hunan Provincial Standing Committee and Changsha City Secretary Hu Heng Hua and Xiang Jun Xin, Leung Jiangang, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei-chan set up a "mini-target" around "Changsha from engineering machinery to smart manufacturing"—the world's leading engineering mechanical industry cluster three or five years later.</seg>
<seg id="2">In Changsha, the world's leading engineering mechanical industry cluster is "the strongest on the surface" in fashionable terms.</seg>
<seg id="3">As an inland provincial capital city, where did the Chang sand shout that proud words?</seg>
<seg id="4">The power of hegemonic leaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four engineering machines in the dialogue, one with a hand-in-chief, covered all areas of the sky, underground, sea and land: the Yamagi smart plane, the Concrete Pumps of the Central Heavy Section, the three-heavy full-ground cranes, the iron heavier tunnel shield, and the "hard power" can be called "hard" and arrogant-looking heroes.</seg>
<seg id="6">At some point, China had little voice in the field of engineering and mechanical manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chinese company was "introduced" and "go out" of the two-wheel drive, taking the winds of the "Right to the Road" initiative, buying, merging, planting, and so forth, and jumping into the world's engineering and mechanical industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among the major economic indicators, such as production, market occupation, and sales, are the leading firms in engineering machinery, such as three-one heavy labourers, the Central Heavyweight, the Iron Heavyweight, and the Yamagi smart.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the camera that manages it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Engineering Mechanics and Xiang Army, "The Four Big Goldmen", is the leader of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Industry and the head of the global engineering mechanical industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the lakes of the global industry, who survived and who survived was the hard-won voice.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the early years, the world's engineering mechanics industry experienced a cold winter, and many internationally known engineering mechanical manufacturing firms were downed, but Changsha's engineering mechanical manufacturing enterprise used "cats winter" as "winter swimming" with pressure, self-breakthroughs, and the transformation of manufacturing from manufacturing to smart, not only strengthening the past but also strengthening the bones.</seg>
<seg id="13">The moon was won by the men and women.</seg>
<seg id="14">The development of niche industries requires both active enterprise and government involvement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Changsha's reputation for "engineering machinery capital" is based on the convergence of all-industrial chains from upstream to downstream, the creation of associated industry clusters, and the significant reduction in the cost of R&amp;D, manufacturing, and sales in enterprises through the optimization of the business environment, the improvement of ancillary services, and the simplification of the approval process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Good business ecology, which allows engineering machinery to be built.</seg>
<seg id="17">History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading engineering machinery, not to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Both the Government and the business sector, as well as the associated manufacturing firms, should take advantage of the opportunities, make it possible to target, sustain and contribute Hunan's power to the building of a strong nation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gansu Qingyang: The lake is packed "to get out of poverty".</seg>
<seg id="2">The September autumn renders the Yellow Plateau.</seg>
<seg id="3">A 58-year-old villager, Xiavelli, in a professional cooperative for the breeding of the breeders in the town of Ma, filled with a last spade in the sheep, and guarded at the beside the lake and chew a white lake sheep.</seg>
<seg id="4">"To eat well, to be full of the autumn and winter, and to get out of the columns for good money."</seg>
<seg id="5">Shavelli said that he fed sheep "special nutritious meals" on a daily basis, regularly cleaned, bacterially sterilized, and did not dare to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shavelli raised sheep for more than 20 years, and did not know how rough sheep had been laid in the past until she was working in a cooperative.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shaveli is a member of the village of Jingyang, Gyeongyang, Gansu Province.</seg>
<seg id="8">His left-right neighbour was a sheep breadwinner, but maintained the traditional diaspora, the sheep was of poor quality and the fence was small.</seg>
<seg id="9">In June this year, under the guidance of the Government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shavelli was buried throughout the day for breeding and breeding, as he had always had a lot of energy in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="11">The shareholders were poor households, all of whom hosted sheep to cooperatives, who could not be divided and sold at a price at the end of the year, but all looked to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the guidance of a skilled man, he slowly learned to prevent the disease, and was given scientific breeding, which became a "good-path" for a small number of breeding in the village.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Benevolent Farming Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lakes and sheep.</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the cooperative, Zou Tao, said that there was a great deal of doorways both inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The wool is thick and easy to breed bacteria, the lake is not allowed to stay in a hot humid place, the sheep shed must be built in a three-sided ditch, and the wind switches must be installed to disperse the heat."</seg>
<seg id="16">Zou Tao said that, in order to prevent the disease, sheep sheds had to be sprayed regularly and sheep had to be treated three to four times a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to living well, "small sheep" has to eat a mixture of maize, weeds, alfalfa, etc., and has a sufficiently wide "gymnasium" brake.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooperatives adopt a custodial alternative approach to directing local farmers to place their lake and goats in the area, to maintain, manage and sell them uniformly, and to achieve good breeding, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.</seg>
<seg id="19">Today, there are 140 poor households with sheep, each with a dividend of more than $6,000 per year, and four pro-poor people working in cooperatives.</seg>
<seg id="20">From "Long Yaman grazing" to "Fooding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "watching, stomaching" to "B-by-B Super" ... In Gansu Qingyang, sheep farming is a shift beyond mere feeding, and the "Longhead Enterprise + Cooperatives + Farmers" model is a change in what was once "heat on the slopes and sheep sold in the marketplace", overcoming the weakness of the traditional farming industry, and the poor of the peasants becoming better off as sheep is modernized.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zou Tao said that if market prices were weak, the local lead company Gansu Sheng Agriculture Development Ltd. would be bought at a guaranteed market price of $27 per kilogram to help farmers diffuse market risks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Xu Jianfeng, General Advisor to Gansu Sheng Shin Agriculture and Ranching Development Ltd., said that businesses had led to an increase in the number of poor households with the idea of "the sheep" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, ordering, bid purchase, uniform processing sales, etc. for poor households.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Qingyang, at least 8200 poor families achieved a steady increase through "allied" agrarian herding, good breeding, mass breeding, slaughter segmentation, and market sales.</seg>
<seg id="24">The city of Qingyang is located in the north's intersections of farming and herding, which is rich in resources.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are 913 meat and sheep farms, cooperatives, with over 5 million meat and sheep breeding, and two processing and production lines with 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughtering sizes in the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Research: A small but still challenging increase in the National Healthy Eating Index in the United States - The New Central Network</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the American Expatriate Network on September 27, a recent study in the United States showed that the U.S. government's healthy diet index had increased moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is not worth celebrating when the score is 100 points.</seg>
<seg id="4">American nationals still face "significant dietary challenges".</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said that Americans still had too much food intake to cause heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, and so on, which were among the most common diseases in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study was published in 24th in the Journal of the American Medical Society.</seg>
<seg id="7">The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">The authors wrote, "Although there has been considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges still exist."</seg>
<seg id="9">These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of foods containing saturated fats, such as zero food, hot dogs, manure cattle, butter, etc. by United States nationals.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in the daily diet increased from 11.5% to 12% and exceeded the recommended 10% intake limit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The largest improvement in the United States diet was the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake was still too high.</seg>
<seg id="12">Officially, the intake of sugar added to the diet should be less than 10 %.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason for the decrease in sugar intake was considered to be related to the reduction in people's consumption of sweet vapor water, but Zhang Aung stressed that sugar was often added to even less sweet foods, such as milk and tomato sauce.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, adult intake of fruit, nuts, oats and other whole cereal categories has increased slightly.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and lower consumption of fruit juice, Zhang Avon indicated that they still accounted for as much as 42% of the daily calorie, many of which came from processed white bread and other precision grains.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study was based on bi-annual personal health surveys, which would allow adults to recall the food they had eaten during the past 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">These health surveys have been asked about this issue twice every few days since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="19">The government's dietary guidelines for residents of the United States recommended the adoption of a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="20">The guide states that people should consume more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruit, whole cereals, low lipid dairy products, as well as fresh, wasted meat, poultry meat, eggs, and seed food that can provide proteins.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of U.S. nationals suffering from diabetes has almost doubled during the study, exceeding 7%, and obesity has also increased over many years—about 70% of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The deepest record of railway tunnels in China was updated</seg>
<seg id="2">After more than 1,200 days of round-the-clock construction on September 27 at Zhang Weiming Xu Jingbo, the first erection of the Gao Ligong Hill tunnel was completed on 27 September, reaching a depth of 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking the record of the deepest erection of the railway tunnel in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 34.5-kilometre-long tunnel of the Gorygon Hill tunnel is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel runs from the West Bank of the Angry River across the Mount Tallagon Mountains, making it the longest single tunnel in two-line holes in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel passed through 19 rifts and buried up to a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covered almost all possible geological and significant risks to the tunnel construction, and the tunnel at Mount Gorygon was known as the "Geological Museum" of the tunnel construction.</seg>
<seg id="5">The wells are the most important auxiliary pits of the tunnel in the Mount Gorygon, and have the important task of increasing the operation of "long tunnels" and later railways for ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The successful digging to the bottom of the well signalled the official entrance of the tunnel to the tunnel at the Mount Tallagon, which could be expanded by four additional fields under the well and speeded up by the opening of the tunnel's main hole, pending the digging and replacement of the underground.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The erection is all in the granite floor, and because the granite is more rifted, the water is not allowed to flow from up to down, and basically the depth pressure of the well is very high."</seg>
<seg id="8">Jing Zhao, the chief engineer of the Tai Rai Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Authority, told reporters that the erection had been carried out with numerous adventures such as dudslides and collapses, and that the builders had invited experts to the field and more than 20 workshops on the treatment programme.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The bottom of the well is more than 300 cubic metres per hour and 700 metres deep, with water pressure equivalent to 700 metres deep."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said, "If water is not drained in a timely manner, we will drowse 10 metres in an hour, we spend almost 85% of our time on water and 15% on excavation."</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to overcome the geological difficulties of longitudinal and artificial development of the rock siege No. 1, the tunnel construction was carried out using a combination of "detection, injection, excavation" and systematic water treatment measures to reduce the risk of construction.</seg>
<seg id="12">After several improvements, the construction of erection No. 1 created mechanized water lines such as the excavation system, ballast system, suspension system, hanging system, etc., and mechanized all-flows such as eyes, blast, ballast, template installation, concrete grouting, and accelerated construction.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ultimately, after more than 1,200 day and night work, the erection was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 metres.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Trans-Swei Railway, which is 330 km long, is an important part of the China–Myanmar International Link, and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "One Road".</seg>
<seg id="15">With the completion of the journey, the Dalian-Rili journey will be shortened from six to two hours on the current highway and will greatly improve transport patterns in the Dian-West region, contributing to China's economic and trade cooperation and people-friendly exchanges with South-East Asian countries.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the State Department's Press Office issued a White Paper on China and the World of the New Era on 27 May.</seg>
<seg id="3">Xu Lin, Vice-Minister and Head of the State Department's Information Office, said that the White Paper focused on "Where China came from and went to China" and "What kind of world China promoted to build" and "How did China develop live with the world", systematically describing China's development achievements, development paths, development paths, and deepening China's relations with the world in order to enhance the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The White Paper states that over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has undergone dramatic changes, creating an unprecedented development miracle in human history, particularly since the 18th largest party, with historic achievements and historic changes in China's development.</seg>
<seg id="5">The White Paper presents, through extensive data and facts, the great achievements, significance and world contribution of China's development over the past 70 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White Paper states that China has spent several decades on the development of the developed countries for hundreds of years, and that its economy has jumped second in the world, with nearly 1.4 billion people lifted out of material shortages, generally reaching a level of minor well-being and enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">The White Paper emphasizes that for 70 years, the Chinese people have been able to start their homes, become self-reliant and struggle hard, and have done a new heaven; for 70 years, China has developed its relations with the world, embraced the world, studied it and contributed to it; and for 70 years, China has contributed to world peace while achieving its own development, giving impetus to the common development of all nations.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the White Paper, the success of China's development over the past 70 years was largely due to the fact that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, had found the correct path of development of Chinese socialism and were firmly and unwavering along that path.</seg>
<seg id="9">The White Paper emphasizes that China's socialist path is one that is based on its own national circumstances, one that places the interests of the people first, one that is innovative in its reform, one that seeks common development in open spaces and one that is fully based on the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="10">China's development path, consistent with China's national circumstances and with the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as time progresses.</seg>
<seg id="11">In response to the international community's concerns about China's development, the White Paper emphasizes that the realization of the wealthy country, the national revival and the well-being of the people is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of all peoples.</seg>
<seg id="12">The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, that all open to the outside world creates more opportunities for the development of all countries, that China offers more public goods to the international community, that China's development offers experience and lessons to other developing countries, and that China will never follow the path of "Big Big Big".</seg>
<seg id="13">Faced with the question of an era of "how the world is and how humanity does it", the White Paper states that today's world is in a state of great change that has not existed for centuries, and that human society is both hopeful and challenging.</seg>
<seg id="14">China proposed the creation of a community of destiny for humanity, a new path of cooperation for win-win and shared development, and new options for human development.</seg>
<seg id="15">The White Paper calls on all nations to unite in the construction of a new type of international relations, to promote a new kind of economic globalization, to preserve the international system centred on the United Nations, to promote the exchange of ideas among civilizations and to work together to build a community of destiny for humanity and a better world.</seg>
<seg id="16">With China's growing development, the international community was generally concerned about how China, which had grown up, could live with the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">The White Paper states that China's development is inseparable from the world, where peaceful development, prosperity and stability are inseparable.</seg>
<seg id="18">China has always placed its own development within the hierarchy of human development, insisted on cooperation for win-win and common development, maintained and promoted economic globalization, actively developed global partnerships, firmly supported multilateralism, upheld international justice with equity, promoted high-quality development along "one-way" lines, actively engaged in leading the reform and construction of the system of global governance, always serving as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order.</seg>
<seg id="19">At present, China has entered a new era of development.</seg>
<seg id="20">The White Paper states that the determination of China in the new era to follow the socialist path of China's identity will not change, the determination of other countries to learn from each other and to work together for the win, and the determination to work with the world will not change.</seg>
<seg id="21">The White Paper concludes by stating that in today's world, the fate of the future of nations has never been so closely linked.</seg>
<seg id="22">The White Paper on China and the World of the New Era, composed of foreword, main text and concluding words, is over 29,000 words in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="23">The White Paper is published in eight languages: Chinese, English, French, Russian, German, Western, Arabic, Japanese, and is published separately by the People's Press and the Foreign Literary Press, and is distributed at the National New China Bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does Manhua stand by-elections for the Danzibia National Assembly seat in Johor?</seg>
<seg id="2">Dato' Seri Wei Jiaxiang, President of the Manhua General Assembly: "Discussion by the Supreme Council of the FLN!"</seg>
<seg id="3">The by-elections for Danzibia's by-elections were a matter of concern, as did the Mahawah, a member of the National Front.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, after a meeting of the MCA, it was announced that the MFN Supreme Council would decide whether to continue with the MF or other members of the MF.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wei Jiaxiang on Thursday afternoon, after presiding over the meetings of the MCA, stated to the media that any by-elections would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), i.e. only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the PFDJ.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that, as the Election Commission would meet on Monday (1 day) next week to finalize the by-elections for the Danzibi by-elections, the PFDJ Supreme Council meeting was expected to be held in early October.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Yesterday morning (26) I also met with the leader of the National Front, Dato' Seri Amadzasi, and we all agreed that this seat must be recaptured from the wants of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We knocked to convene a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, and the three-party leader of the National Front would determine which of its members would come up."</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiring whether the MCA would insist on standing for this traditional seat in the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as President of the MCA, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and that any decision must be taken by consensus of the National Front.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is a common practice for any by-elections to be conscripted, for political parties, and for some to believe that they should come out."</seg>
<seg id="11">"What are our most important organizations and political coalitions?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is the test of forming a political alliance for many years, and we believe that the National Front is on its way, with some valuable values."</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's not surprising that someone may say something in this process."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, once the Supreme Council of the National Front has taken a decision, all must be fully prepared to fight, which is the most expensive."</seg>
<seg id="15">In any event, Wei Jiaxiang stated that Mawawah would make every effort to prepare for the by-elections at the Duke Danzig by-election at three levels, namely, the District Council, the State Board and the Central Committee.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The district council is headed by Dato' Seri Yellow Day, the chairman of the district council; the state committee will be headed by Dato' Lind Paxing, the chairman of the Board of Governors; and Dato' Mahanshun, the president of the council, and Dato' Zhang, the general secretary, will be deployed in the centre."</seg>

<seg id="1">A villager in Bokang County, Hubei, who hunted wildlife was ordered to "Obligatory Patrol Mountains".</seg>
<seg id="2">A villager was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15420 yuan (RMB, Lower Yuan) for the restoration of environmental damage to ecological resources.</seg>
<seg id="3">Due to the impoverishment of the defendant's family, the Public Prosecutor's Office introduced alternative labour to compensate for the costs of ecological rehabilitation, resulting in an organic unification of the legal and social effects.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wang Zhongliang, Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Paokang County, introduced on 27 July that the defendant had established a deep feeling with wild macaque monkeys through alternative work such as a three-month "compulsory tour mountain" and was deeply responsible for the previous hunting of animals.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 21 June this year, a case filed by the Office of the Procurator of the Prefectural Prosecutor of Baucang in the area of ecological resources was heard and handed down in a public hearing in the District Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defendant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, four years' probation and a fine of 3,000 yuan, and was ordered to pay 15420 yuan for the repair of environmental damage to ecological resources.</seg>
<seg id="7">In late January 2014, an electric grid was set up in the cliffs, and more than 20 animals were hunted, including zebra, macjacke, and fur crested deer.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zebra is an endangered species of wildlife, and macadjacs and crown deer are listed in the National List of Terrestrial Wildlife Conservation.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the hearing, he confessed to his own wrongdoing and behaviour and was willing to assume subsidiary civil liability.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in view of the poor financial situation of one of the families of the week, the local village council, the forest station, and one of the three parties of the week, in coordination with the Office of the Procurator of the canton of Baucang, entered into an agreement to compensate for the cost of the ecological restoration of the alternative labour: the provision of public service labour to cover the cost of ecological rehabilitation through the operation of kiwi breeding, compulsory patrolling mountains and forest protection in the village kiwiqi reserve for one year.</seg>
<seg id="11">In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the court accepted the obligation of "alternative labour to compensate for the costs of ecological rehabilitation" while agreeing to a suspended sentence.</seg>
<seg id="12">At present, the mountains have been active and performed well when they have been working in kiwi reserves for three months.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the Office of the Procurator of the canton of Paolo has in practice integrated the prosecutorial function and the conduct of social governance, and scientific supervision has been used to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through the use of judicial means such as prosecutorial advice, investigation supervision, and prosecution supervision.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United Nations awards the "Earth Guards Prize" for the "Ant Forest"</seg>
<seg id="2">In a lively acclaim and magnificent musical sound, the head of the Ant Forest project Xu Desi and user representative Shen Junliang took to the podium, where they received the 2019 United Nations Champions of the Earth Award from the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2019 Champions of the Earth Award ceremony was held in New York City, United States, where the Ant Forest project, which involved hundreds of millions of people in environmental action, was awarded the Incentives and Action Award.</seg>
<seg id="4">A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the list of awards at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, but those who had attended the ceremony on the same day were still hard to hide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingue Annoshen, in an interview with a New China News Agency journalist, said that the "ant forest" was an exciting innovation that brought hundreds of millions of people into action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do about the environment.</seg>
<seg id="6">It connects people and the environment with science and technology, allowing each individual to participate in actions to protect the Earth, which will have a great impact.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the Chinese Ant Financial Services Group (Chinese Ant Financial Services Group) on a gem-paying platform, where users accumulate "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording green travels in their daily lives in ant forest, payment of hydropower on-line, and "breeding trees" in mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each user breeds a virtual tree, ant forest, and a public benefit partner breeding a true tree in a desert area.</seg>
<seg id="9">By August of this year, 500 million users of ant forests had accumulated carbon reductions of 7.92 million tonnes and 122 million trees had been planted in desertification areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costa Rica was awarded the "Guardians of the Earth Award" for its national environmental efforts, and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contributions of the "ant forest" "which inspired so many people to take part in green action".</seg>
<seg id="11">The chairman and chief executive officer of ant's ant appetite said that the "Earth Guardian Award" was an affirmation of the "Ant Forest" project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Kenzo Wai, the "ant forest" has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the "ant forest" for the next three years is to bring about the participation of 1 billion people around the world in low-carbon actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase the income of farmers from green water in Qingshan.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to increase their harvests through agricultural development projects, electrical platforms, etc.</seg>
<seg id="16">The digital-based public-friendly environmental model created by the Ant Forest has also been successfully used by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In June of this year, the largest "electronic wallet" in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Philippine users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was reported that GCash would work with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and EPG, among others, to plan for the planting of 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project's launch.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Guardians of the Earth Prize is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually.</seg>
<seg id="20">The "Ant Forest" award was awarded for the third year in a row to the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction of the Sehang Dam Forest in China, the Thousand Village Demonstration in Zhejiang Province in China, and the Wan Village Restoration Project.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade friction affected the U.S. economy's "Bank of Outcomes".</seg>
<seg id="2">The U.S. economy's "Report Sheet" for the second quarter of this year showed that the U.S. GDP growth rate was significantly slower than in the previous quarter, as a result of a significant decline in private sector investment and exports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Analysts pointed out that trade friction and the uncertainty it brought about were the main causes of the downturn in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The final revised data released by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 June showed that the United States GDP grew by 2 per cent per year in the second quarter, at the same rate as the previously published revised figures, but was significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Data show that consumption growth has been the main factor underpinning American economic growth in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Individual consumption expenditure, which accounted for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the quarter, pulling economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, government spending on consumption and investment pulled economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, private sector investment fell by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, dragging the current season's economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell by 5.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter; and net exports dragged up by 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Barry Knapp, Managing Partner of the Einside Macroeconomic Consulting Corporation of the United States, said that private sector investment had not only failed to sustain the growth momentum of the previous year, but had declined significantly because of the blow to business confidence caused by increased trade friction and uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Knapp, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain downward next year due to policy uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="11">Analysts argue that while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that trade friction and the uncertainty it has brought about have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected United States consumption prospects.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Richard Curtin, the head of the survey and professor of economics at the University of Michigan, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers referred spontaneously to the negative effects of tariffs on the United States economy, a rate that was new in the year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="13">For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally agreed that the United States economy would continue to slow.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, it was also suggested that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if trade friction was mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Economist's Economist's Economist Global Economist Celine Burge predicts that the United States economy will continue this year's gradual downward trend in the future, and that the rate of increase will be lower than in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandy, predicted that the U.S. economy would increase by 2.3 per cent this year, assuming that trade friction would not continue to escalate, and would slow further to 1.6 per cent next year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ellen Harzen, investment manager of Patnan Investment, noted that the greatest concern of the business was the trade and economic dispute and the uncertainty it brought about, which would be significantly less uncertain and the industry would perform much better than it was now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Miller-Tabac Asset Management Stock Policyor Matt Melley said that trade friction remained the "primary problem" and the main cause of this year's high volatility in the capital markets of the United States, and that trade friction would be the key to influencing the movement of the capital markets in the United States for the remainder of this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Minister of Finance Liu Quin: Sixty-seven central and financial institutions have been transferred to the State to replenish the Social Security Fund with a total of 860.1 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Minister of Finance, Liu Qun 27, stated that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to replenish the Social Security Fund, totalling approximately 860.1 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Liu Quin made the above statement at the National Conference on the Deployment of State-owned Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, which was held on the same day by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Commission on Finance.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The transfer of State-owned capital to augment the Social Security Fund is an important step in reforming and improving the basic pension insurance system, a fully shared and equitable intergenerational expression of the development results of State-owned enterprises and the basic pension insurance system, and an ongoing, long-term policy measure."</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2017, the State Council issued the Programme for the Implementation of the Fund for the Transfer of State-owned Capital, which called for the selection of selected central enterprises and selected provinces to be piloted.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Liu Quin, the forward transfer has yielded positive results.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the central level, three groups of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, with a total capital transfer of approximately 860.1 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in the Ministry of Finance, which performs the functions of financial contributors, has largely been completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Central enterprises have been transferred on a scale.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises is carried out successively.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the end of 2018, the pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been largely completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan, respectively, transferred to State-owned capital.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to the pilot provinces, pre-drawn preparations have been carried out in other provinces, laying the foundation for further roll-over.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the circulars issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Financial Commission, the General Directorate of Revenue, and the CVM, the central and local transfers of State-owned capital to replenish the Social Security Fund were fully rolled out in 2019 and largely completed by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="14">The meeting held on the same day resulted in specific deployments for the full roll-out of the transition.</seg>
<seg id="15">The need to carry out the transfer exercise in a pragmatic and efficient manner was emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="16">In accordance with the schedule, the transfer will be largely completed by the end of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There's a lot of work and a lot of work.</seg>

<seg id="1">The transfer of state funds to the Social Security Fund—from the beginning of the "Enrichment of the Social Security Fund's Money Package" to the purpose of providing strong support for old-age security.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, according to the author, this was not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but rather a "mathematical addition".</seg>
<seg id="3">On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of People's Welfare, the National Finance Commission, the General Directorate of Taxation, and the CVM jointly issued the Circular on the Full Expansion of the Work of the Fund for the Enrichment of State-owned Capital Transfer, which specifies the timetable for the transfer of State-owned funds, i.e. the Central and Local Transfer of State-owned Capital Enrichment of the Fund, which was fully inaugurated in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">Following the publication of the document, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were soon followed up.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10 per cent of the shares held in the Bank of Commerce and Industry and the Bank of Agriculture to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under the terms of this provision, subject subjects such as social security foundations, as financial investors, have the right to the proceeds, disposition and information of the assigned shares in the State.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company, the farm company, stated in the announcement that the change in interest would not result in a change in the shareholders and the de facto controllers of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">In response, the pencil argued that a similar transfer of State equity was not a simple change in the attribution of shares, but rather a "additional operation" capable of triggering a series of effects.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first step of some state transfers to social security is the "additional outcome", which naturally reflects the national ownership of state-owned enterprises, with development outcomes shared by all.</seg>
<seg id="10">After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, especially central ones, are mostly in important industries and areas of our economy, with overall profitability being stronger and more stable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, the lead firms are more likely to be able to achieve good results on a sustainable basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 10 July, the State Council, at its Standing Committee, decided that the transfer of State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund would be fully rolled out this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ministry of Finance subsequently indicated that it would be in a position to fully operationalize the transfer of some State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, in line with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, fully reflecting intergenerational equity in the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of the development of State-owned enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second step of the shift, the "additional results", is to enhance the sustainability of our social security funds and to further strengthen the foundations of the old-age social security system.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the ageing of our population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of this national capital, which is a transferred subject, has sustained profitability and dividends, not only to be able to effectively supplement the social security funds, but also to provide a source of living water for them.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has been measured that, for each transfer of 3.8 percentage points of State capital, a reduction of 1 percentage point in the contribution rate to support basic pension insurance in an enterprise is possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third step of the shift, the "additional result", is the addition of stabilizers to capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="18">This transfer is carried out in a way that "mainly dividends, with transport as a complement".</seg>
<seg id="19">The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor of State-owned capital, is indeed the main source of dividend gains.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, social security funds, as value investors in capital markets, have greater capacity to operate capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">For listed assets in State-owned capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of publicly listed enterprises and will contribute to raising the level of business activity and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the WSSF, as an investment trend, has increased its equity weighting, which has helped to further increase its influence in the market and has a "stabilizer" role in the market.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the "value discovery" function of institutional investors can be used to guide investors in rational and value investments.</seg>

<seg id="1">China's development was an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="2">(70 New China) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="3">The White Paper states that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="4">The White Paper states that with the rapid increase in China's combined national and international influence, there are international fears that China will follow the path of the "Big Bang", and some have proposed the so-called "Chinese threat theory".</seg>
<seg id="5">This is both cognitive misinterpretation, deep-rooted bias, and psychological disequilibrium resulting from power growth, as well as deliberate distortions in the interest of self-determined interests.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is the dream of the Chinese people as well as the common dream of the people of all countries to achieve the wealth of the country, its national revival and its happiness.</seg>
<seg id="7">"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge."</seg>
<seg id="8">The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China's scientific and technological innovation injected new dynamic energy into world economic growth, and that the future role of the stabilizer and power source in China's economy has become more prominent.</seg>
<seg id="9">The world economy is currently under-powered by economic growth, and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">China's economy was shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, rapid modernization of agriculture, deep restructuring of the economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and the emergence of new economic growth points.</seg>
<seg id="11">A study by the McKinsey Global Academy found that by 2040, China's integration with the rest of the world was expected to create an economic value of between $22 trillion and $37 trillion, equivalent to 15 - 26 per cent of the total global economy, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world and China would create great economic value."</seg>
<seg id="12">The White Paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.</seg>
<seg id="13">China, with more stable economic performance, higher quality growth and promising growth prospects, had long-term benefits for world economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is neither feasible nor harmful to see China's economic development as a "threat" nor a "challenge", and to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains, and to "de-link" China from the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="15">The White Paper states that full openness creates more opportunities for countries to share "Chinese dividends".</seg>
<seg id="16">China was firmly committed to a win-win and open-ended strategy, with greater vigour and a higher level of external openness, with China having the world's most potent consumer market, China being the most attractive destination for investment, and more large-scale "go-and-go" for the benefit of more countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Open openings should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="18">For mutual benefit to be durable in both directions."</seg>
<seg id="19">The White Paper stated that China was committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take appropriate steps to improve their business environment.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is only by moving forward that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win environment for development can be created, with the greater the "cake" of development together and a mutually beneficial community of interests.</seg>
<seg id="21">The White Paper states that China provides the international community with more public goods.</seg>
<seg id="22">This includes promoting high-quality "track-by-track" co-operation, multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active external assistance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"China's development has benefited from the international community and has always been remembered for the family of nations, providing the international community with more and better public goods."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Twitter theme label and the community media are strongly advocating that the Egyptian people take to the streets today and peacefully claim the resignation of President Sessi.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since Sessi, the then head of the military, began a military coup d'état in 2013 to seize the handles of power, dissenting the matter has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is more likely to be in extreme danger.</seg>
<seg id="5">The British Guardian reported that the Cairo non-governmental organization, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, stated that more than 1,900 people had been arrested since the rare protests calling for Sessi to be removed last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="6">Allegations of glorious corruption surrounding Sessi and his family led to thousands of people marching on the streets from 20 to 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior took a firm position yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be decisively welcomed and never softened.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city centre of Cairo had already been on high alert, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plain-clothes policemen were visible on the streets around Tahrir Square, which was the scene of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="9">Al-Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of key scholars and social sons on 25 days, including a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist Nafa.</seg>
<seg id="10">He had sent a tweet on 24 days: "I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Sessi would cause disaster."</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is in the interest of Egypt that he step down immediately."</seg>
<seg id="12">Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, a spokesman for Anan, former chief of staff of the Egyptian military, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sessi for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="14">The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic hardship of the poor and the middle class is worsening, the dissident approach reflects the instability and fragility of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Leader of the Opposition, Ayman Nour, who had championed the President, said: "The catch-up underscores how much the regime is indifferent to the Egyptian people and how horror it itself is."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since the economy has been wiped out by him, together with widespread political oppression, Sessi tries to send a clear message to important generals and politicians who may be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nol noted that the Government's high-handed approach would only increase people's anger in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the barrier of fear had been broken, he expected more people to go to the streets.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ali, a merchant and actor in exile in Spain, had been an Egyptian military construction contractor and had started uploading a series of films early in the month, benefiting from the corruption of the government and detonating small demonstrations in various cities over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ali stated that his company's Amrake General Contract would be able to obtain a lucrative contract without the required bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and Sécy's relatives, including the First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="22">He expressed deep regret that he had been involved in it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ali claims that his own help to Sesigue's Fully Hall Palace and the Luxiliary Hotel is in stark contrast to the current Egyptian living in abject poverty and has not yet been paid.</seg>
<seg id="24">On Twitter, subject labels such as "To stand up and you're not alone", "Sessi Your Eggs", "Sessied" and "Next Friday", have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and backs, calling for people to move to the streets in a peaceful manner to demand that Sessi be removed.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Hollywood Egyptian boy star Amawake's Twitter has nearly 7 million followers.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said in a tweet in Arabic yesterday: "Sexi is bound to end the egg ... he is finished, and those who support him are now going to commit a big mistake."</seg>

<seg id="1">Let Chinese citizens "go out" and be more comfortable—to visit Choi Yimin, head of the consular department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</seg>
<seg id="2">Everywhere, your country is behind you.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 25 May, the first Foreign Ministry's short film on consular protection of the public good was on the line, and the phrase ending with the short film resonated with a wide range of online friends.</seg>
<seg id="4">The head of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Choi Yimin, stated in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency reporter that the short film was intended to further the people's feelings and temperatures of "diplomacy as a citizen" and that Chinese citizens would feel aid, strength and hope from Chinese diplomats in any part of the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is no small thing to be safe overseas, and there is a one-way-all affair.</seg>
<seg id="6">Choi Yimin said that the number of Chinese citizens "go out" had increased sharply over the past 70 years, from "less than a million" before the reform and opening to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, Chinese citizens' travel abroad was more secure, and consular protection and assistance was extended from overseas Chinese nationals to various groups such as Chinese expatriates, tourists, students and workers.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to statistics, since the 18th largest party, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or transfers of Chinese citizens abroad, and more than 40,000 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from dangerous and volatile areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">It received and coordinated approximately 500,000 requests for assistance, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.</seg>
<seg id="9">At a dangerous moment, the motherland can bring you home; it's no longer a dream of a "go-and-go journey".</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Choi Amin, by the end of August this year, China had concluded visa-free agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted entry facilities to Chinese citizens, such as visa waivers or landing visas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Forty-two countries and territories, including Thailand and Egypt, have granted Chinese citizens with ordinary passports a visa to land, while another 15 countries and territories, including Indonesia, have granted Chinese citizens with ordinary passports a visa-free entry.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to arrangements such as visa waivers and loading, Chinese citizens are also seeking visas more easily and more streamlined procedures.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">These include agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina for the granting of 10-year and multiple visas to tourists, businessmen, and two-year visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for travel, business and family visits.</seg>
<seg id="16">The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a "visa one-stop" service, with France, Italy and Singapore reducing the processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="17">Multi-entry and easy-cut APEC business travel cards are a good option for businesspeople who often leave the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Choi Amin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining more than five-year visas in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and is important for businessmen, especially private business personnel, to "go out".</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, China has the highest level of active card holding in APEC economies.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens in more countries, translate the results of the diplomatic work more into the Favorite Liberty initiative, and continuously increase the "gold content" of Chinese passports.</seg>

<seg id="1">The President of Sélis held plans to complete the last year's call for an increase of 43% of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the evening of 25 September, Sélis (603716.SH) announced that Wen Wei, the company's de facto controller and director, had increased the company's shares by a total of 1,054,200, or 0.5139 per cent of the company's total share capital, by means of a pooled bidding transaction, and that the increase was in the amount of RMB 2,992,600 (including stamp tax, commissions, interest, etc.) and that the increase was completed.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was reported that prior to the implementation of the increase, Wenwei held 8.58 million shares directly in Seleis, or 4.18% of the company's total stock, and the holding shareholder, Sino-American Science Instruments Ltd., Tianjin City (hereinafter "Tianjin Sino-American"), owned 82,483,500 shares of the company, or 40.06% of the company's total stock, and Wenwei held 66.06% of Tianjin Sino-American, which was the company's de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a matter of concern that this was not the first time that Sélis had sacrificed a profit.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a short period of one year since September last year, Sélis successively introduced measures such as high-capacity growth, the Chairman's peddling of the initiative, the buy-back of shares, and equity incentives.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 18 September last year, Sélis announced that the company's seven additional senior managers, such as Liu Wenhau, had accumulated 394,300 shares (0.1922 per cent of the company's total stock) in the company, totalling $7.022,900, and that the current plan for the increase had been completed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shortly afterwards, President Seleis and the real-world administrator made an initiative to increase the company's stock plans and promised to compensate for losses.</seg>
<seg id="8">The period of the increase was 19 October to 31 October 2018 and the total amount of the company's shares increased to not more than $150 million, with the company's shares held continuously for more than 12 months, without reduction, and the employee was in service at the time of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Journalists corollary found that Sélis had a minimum share price of 14.02 yuan and a maximum of 16.44 yuan for the period of the initiative's employees, with a maximum surplus of 42.80 per cent and a minimum of 21.78 per cent at the Sélis disc price of 20.02 yuan on September 25.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 21 January this year, Sélis again passed a buy-back to the company's shares program, announcing that the total amount to be used to buy back shares would be no less than 160 million yuan, and no more than 280 million yuan.</seg>
<seg id="11">On 8 August of this year, the company issued the Sélis Restrictive Stock Incentive Plan (Draft) 2019, and set high performance unlocking conditions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The announcement showed that the equity incentive was based on 2018 operating income, with growth rates of not less than 30 per cent, 70 per cent, 120 per cent and 185 per cent for each of the four accounting years 2019-2022.</seg>
<seg id="13">Seleys' performance in the first half of the year showed that the company maintained high growth and exceeded the 30 per cent performance growth unlocked this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the first half of the year, business income was 842 million yuan, an increase of 46.50 per cent over the same period; the net profit attributable to shareholders in listed companies was 562,324,000 yuan, an increase of 16.46 per cent over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the five consecutive reporting periods since the 2018 report, Sélis's harvest increased by more than 38 percent, with a maximum increase of 59 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2018, the company established a twin-core-driven coordinated development strategy based on medical testing intensive operation services (IVD operations), a breakthrough of the Medical Consumption Operations Service (SPD operations) and the Regional Testing Centre, which was upgraded iteratively to build on the advantages of the existing IVD operations and advance SPD operations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sélis told reporters that all three of Sélis's operations were steadily advancing in response to the trend towards medical improvement and rapid expansion.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the area of SPD operations, in January of this year, Seleis announced the signing of a three-year contract with the People's Hospital of the City of Lindu and the Central Hospital of the City of Lindu for cooperation in the construction and day-to-day operation of the medical-consuming operating platform and management services.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, Sélis is greatly expanding the SPD business by providing intensive services in medical facilities such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution and settlement of medical consumables for long-term income.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the above-mentioned sources.</seg>
<seg id="21">On 17 September, according to the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network's Zhejiang Government Procurement Information Platform for the Purchase of Services in the Zhejiang Government, Sélis marked an "Extension of Logistics Services (with reagents) in the Hospital of Shaw Yef Hospital, affiliated with the Zhejiang University Medical School".</seg>
<seg id="22">Pharmaceutical sector analysts have pointed out that the award is highly gold-containing, that Shao Yifu Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the JCI, and that the successful implementation of the project in the future is also an important development opportunity for the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to its analysis, prior to Seleys's regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and mergers and acquisitions, the business map almost completed the operational regional coverage of the country's provinces.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the Middle Shaof Hospital and the next city in Zhejiang should continue replicating the model in different hospitals to enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this year Sélis was also working in emerging areas such as industrial marijuana, block chain technology, etc.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to increase political standing, strengthen political responsibility, take stock of the problems and improve the quality of the work of the Party for the Construction, Governance and Reform of Higher Education.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ulan fully acknowledged the initial results achieved by undergraduate colleges in the second series of thematic education.</seg>
<seg id="4">She noted that the "First Heart, Keep the Mission" education was a major deployment in the central party, and that undergraduate colleges were required to study in depth the important message of the Secretary-General of Jinping on the subject of "First Heart, Keep the Mission" education.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the strengthening of the "four consciousness", the "two defences", the political heights of the original mission, the careful completion of the various provisions of the subject education, in particular the series of issues examined in a solid manner, the integration of the school reform and development efforts, and the achievement of the "twofold promotion".</seg>
<seg id="6">Ulan stressed the need to keep the blade in the direction, to look for the problem, to query the bid, to ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, to seriously and profoundly analyse the root causes, so as to clarify the direction of the effort and to improve the initiatives, and to make hard-won attempts to break down the problem, as required by the "four checks".</seg>
<seg id="7">It is necessary to maintain precision, to strengthen real change, and to ensure that the word "reforms" permeates all time.</seg>
<seg id="8">A combination of thematic education and the work of the "Little Tree" is needed to ensure that the problem is not lost, that it is zero-sum and that it is effective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sample and cure must be maintained, long-lasting mechanisms should be improved, the cage system should be strengthened, the rigidity of the system should be strengthened, and work should be regulated and regulated, and the system should be genuinely administered.</seg>
<seg id="10">In keeping with the above, the leading cadres take the lead in strengthening doctrinal armament, taking the lead in carefully reviewing reorientation and taking the lead while doing so, playing a "critical minority" role as a demonstration and working to complete the task of reorienting the subject education.</seg>
<seg id="11">Five higher education party committees, including Hunan University, were responsible for gay and provincial direct-related units and made statements to their peers.</seg>

<seg id="1">The two main hypertension projects "Something Up" were put into operation</seg>
<seg id="2">On 26 June, the Quasi-East to the Anhui-Anhui-Anhui-Nan ±1100 kV high volt high-pressure direct current transmission project, and the 1,000 kV high-pressure GIL integrated gallery in Suitung.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both projects occupy the current high point in each of the world's electricity transmission technologies, and their delivery will result in significant improvements in the country's energy mix.</seg>
<seg id="4">The National Energy Agency's chief economist, Guo Ji, stated that the Quasi-East to Anhui-Anhui-South Project was the most power-delivery and power-delivery project in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its delivery was important for the development of the Xinjiang energy base and the provision of electricity to the East China region.</seg>
<seg id="6">GIL, a closed electrical transmission line for gas insulation metal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Suiteng Gallery Project created the GIL Project's highest global voltage-level record and highest transmission capacity, and implemented the "Communication Double Circle" ring of the East China Dry Network at the highest voltage level.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the National Electricity Grid Company, the Quasi-East to the Anhui-Anhui-South Project has a power transfer distance of 3,324 km.</seg>
<seg id="9">Using conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost while the project will be developed and developed, resulting in a significant increase in the economic transport distance to more than 3,000 km.</seg>
<seg id="10">With the delivery of the Quasi-East to Anhui-Anhui-South Project, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, helping to break the absorption problem of the new energy available in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is estimated that this line will be running from 600 to 85 billion kilowatt-hours per year alone, which will cover more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity use.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Souton GIL Integrated Gallery Project is a controlled high-pressure communication loop network across the Yangtze River.</seg>
<seg id="13">A conventional air route across the river would require the erection of two large iron towers more than 450 metres above the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of four soccer stadium size for each of the towers.</seg>
<seg id="14">In response, the national electricity grid has boldly innovated, developing compact hypertension communication GIL transmission technology, and passing underwater through tunnels to avoid impact on gold lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Two projects have led to new leapfrogs in the country's electrical manufacturing capacity.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, the National Grid has accumulated the "10-to-11-directional" hypertension project, and the "4-to-three-direction" project is under construction.</seg>

<seg id="2">"In general, the structure of our external debt continues to be optimized and the stability of our external debt has increased."</seg>
<seg id="3">The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Authority and the Economist-General Wang Chun Ying 27 stated that the main indicators of our foreign debt were within the internationally recognized security line and that the external debt risk was generally manageable.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wang Spring-Ying made this statement in response to a question from a journalist when the foreign exchange agency published data on its external debt at the end of June 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">The data show that as at the end of June 2019, the country's total external debt balance (including foreign currency) was $1998 billion, an increase of $26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, compared with the end of March 2019, largely due to the growth in the debt securities balance.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the second quarter of 2019, the country's full-calibre external debt grew by more than 70 per cent, driven by the purchase of domestic currency bonds by non-residents, who were mainly middle- and long-term investors such as the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="7">By the end of June 2019, the medium- and long-term external debt had risen by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019, and the local currency's external debt had risen by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wang Chunying said that international investors' recognition of the Chinese bond market continued to increase with the inclusion of the national currency bonds in the Bloombo Barclays Global Aggregate Index in April 2019.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The country's balance of payments is generally balanced and the external debt risk is manageable."</seg>

<seg id="1">Journalists learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27 that the Yunnan grassland greedy moth was now effectively protected, and that it did not cause large-scale riots, and that the control effort had been phased in.</seg>
<seg id="2">In January of this year, Jiangcheng County, Yunnampu'er city, discovered for the first time grass moth from outside China, and subsequently confirmed in 129 Yunnan counties that it had spread from Yunnan to China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grassland greed moth is an important agricultural pest in the tropics and subtropical regions of the Americas, and a major evangelized pest in the FAO Global Early Warning, with "international, evangelistic, eruptive and destructive characteristics".</seg>
<seg id="4">The pest harms more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and can cause up to 70 per cent of the lost production.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is difficult to prevent and treat, and there is no registered pesticide to treat the pest in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the invasion of Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eidong Fellows to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences' agricultural cross-border harmful organisms in collaboration with the Green Control Department's innovation team, to travel to the first line, to conduct field surveys, to collect samples and to conduct technical guidance and test demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Eidong's team has acquired initial population characteristics of the Yunnan grassland greed moth, sky trichlorfon resources, extraneous pests, population trajectories, drug toxicity and field control effects.</seg>
<seg id="8">They have been active in green control technology research and applications, and have achieved more than 90 per cent control in demonstration areas through the implementation of new green prevention technologies such as population monitoring, insect booby-traps, scientific pharmacies and agronomic measures, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for effective control of the eruption of grassland garbage moths and sustainable management.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, Yunnan grassland greedy moths have been effectively protected, with no major outbreaks, and the control has been phased in.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecology mechanism of population relocation and invasion, breaking through the bioprophylaxis and green control technology system.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, cross-border international cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country in order to improve the monitoring and early warning capabilities of the full range of moths in the Yunnan grassland.</seg>

<seg id="1">White Paper: China's way out of a development path appropriate to the national context</seg>
<seg id="2">On 27 September, China's Beijing News Office of the State Council issued a White Paper on China and the World of the New Era.</seg>
<seg id="3">The White Paper states that for 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and sharpen the front lines, successfully opening up the socialist path of China's identity and achieving remarkable development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The White Paper states that China's development is based on self-reliance and hard work.</seg>
<seg id="5">China's development was based on the true spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" and the unimaginable struggle of generations to pay for the hard labour and sweating water of others; on the spirit of responsibility of "his own bearers to carry their own", whether in the future or in the face of adversity, not to export problems, not to marry contradictions, not to develop themselves by buying and plundering other countries; and on the spirit of exploration of "matching the stones over the river", not to follow the old imperialist, colonialist and Western models of national development, but rather to combine China's actual experience, lessons learned, to learn from human civilization, to brave into the test and to move on its own path.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White Paper states that China has developed in its interaction with the world, that China's development has invested positive energy in world peace and development, and that China's paths are consistent with China's national circumstances and with the requirements of the times.</seg>
<seg id="7">China maintains world peace through practical action.</seg>
<seg id="8">For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict and has not occupied an inch of the land of another country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The White Paper states that the main reason for the great success of China's development over the past 70 years was to find the correct path of development of Chinese socialism, and to continue along that path with determination.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the path of establishing a State based on its own national circumstances, giving priority to the interests of its people, reforming innovations, pursuing common development in open spaces and fully governed by the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="11">China, which was immense in size and complex in its country, had little governance difficulty and had no unified and strong leadership, and would move towards division and dissolution, causing disaster to the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the White Paper, over 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created another Chinese miracle of world interest.</seg>
<seg id="13">In particular, since its 18th largest Chinese nation, China has achieved historic achievements in its development and has undergone historic changes, and the Chinese nation has embraced a great leap from standing up, richer to strong, closer to the great goal of national revival than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="14">This path of development in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times progress.</seg>

<seg id="3">A number of desk representatives and scholars were invited to share experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market development.</seg>
<seg id="4">The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Administration and was co-sponsored by organizations such as the Group Golden Ding Securities and the Outstanding Continental Taipei Friendship.</seg>

<seg id="6">Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Institute of Business Administration, said that Chinese-American trade friction persisted and Taiwanese merchants faced "a period of uncertainty".</seg>
<seg id="7">In his view, desktops needed to keep up with the mainstream industries of continental development, paying particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Past Taiwanese merchants have focused on quality, effectiveness and delivery."</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Chen Mingzhang, the only conditions mentioned above are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="10">He stated that Taiwanese firms were more likely to combine speed and service, speed up supply chains and focus on extension services and life product services.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, "services added value" is a new area in which desktops can develop significantly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking at the meeting, the Chair of the Board of Directors of Taiwan Shu Wen Hall, Guangdong's Taiwan Shu Memoir Electronics Company Limited, said that Amo Electronics had experienced operational difficulties as a result of the abrupt reduction of orders, and that the group had started to improve its operations from a variety of orientations, including tone structures, activated assets, etc.</seg>

<seg id="2">Qualification of social capital for rural land ownership</seg>
<seg id="3">Publicly solicited advice on the proposed regulation of the transfer of social capital, such as business enterprises, to land ownership</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development website published a public consultation note on "Rural land tenure transfer management practices (revised draft for comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "the draft opinion") which increased regulation and risk protection for social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to access land tenure.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Draft Opinion is now openly sought from the community.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, further consolidate and improve the rural basic operating system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "triple-rotation" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the rural land contracting rights transfer management scheme, resulting in a draft opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Beijing Youth Journal reporter learned of several important changes to the Draft Opinion, which was first published.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "triple-rotation", devotes separate sections to "land contracting" and "land operating rights", and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, interchange and transfer of land ownership (renting, subcontracting, equity or other means).</seg>
<seg id="9">In this draft, in order to give effect to the concept of "triple-rotation" and to respond effectively to the thrust of the amendments to the Rural Land Contracting Act, and taking into account the considerable differences between land-rotation and land-contracting rights, transfer between the parties, procedures and regulations, this revision defines the range of shifts, focusing on land-rotting, including through rent, equity, etc., and the name of the regulations was changed from the Rural Land-Contracting Transfer Management Scheme to the Rural Land-Control Transfer Management Scheme.</seg>
<seg id="10">The transfer and interchange of rights to land contracting will be regulated separately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Draft Opinion states that in the context of the "triple separation of powers", farmers' shareholding is only a fixed-term right to land.</seg>
<seg id="12">In theory, even in the event of a bankruptcy settlement, the farmers were only at risk of losing their business rights for a certain period of time, and there was therefore no need to provide for a contractual return to the original contractor in law, and there was a conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">With regard to the protection of farmers against the risk of land loss, priority shares, pre-rental shares, repurchase and so forth have been introduced in practice.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that priority units are well-developed doctrines in company law, it is recommended that they be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of equity loss.</seg>
