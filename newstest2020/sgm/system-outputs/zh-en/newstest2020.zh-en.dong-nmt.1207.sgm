<seg id="1">Women's volleyball team expected to defend World Cup early!</seg>
<seg id="2">27, against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was pulled back into a city by their opponents after winning two games in a row, eventually ending a nine-game winning streak with 3: 1 remaining.</seg>
<seg id="3">The World Cup is nearing the end of the tournament, although the title is in sight, but in the face of Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team must not be taken lightly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first two innings of the match with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever, dropping two cities at 25: 19, 25: 16, until the third inning, the team suffered a setback.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened their serve in the backfield, the Chinese team suffered a shock, and the girls began to attack, and mistakes began to increase, eventually being pulled back to the city by their opponents at 21: 25.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the game, Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "The third inning, because of the error we sent about eight points."</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball team was prepared for difficulties before the match, although losing a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's hands. "It is normal to win the game with the strong team, and it is normal to play five games, so we say to focus on the team," Lang Ping said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the fourth inning, the team actively adjusted, Zhang Changning in the offensive end firepower all open, the single game got eight points, for the team to win big.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 11-round confrontation so far has only two rounds left, and while the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, it does ring alarm bells for the Chinese women's volleyball team in the game against the Dutch: The more critical moments, the more effort.</seg>
<seg id="10">In another game on May 27, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams played five games, and the U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team could defend its title in advance by taking all three points against Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything is moving in the interests of the Chinese women's volleyball team.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, while Serbia's six major teams are missing, it does not mean they will give the Chinese team three points easily.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the form of the current tally, the Serbian team has largely lost medals, meaning they can "play lightly" against the Chinese women's volleyball team, put down the burden to hit their opponents, and the Chinese team is under pressure to win the title, but the state may fluctuate.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not a "slaughtered" lamb, after five games with the Dutch, the Serbian team eventually reversed the Dutch all-important lineup 3: 2, thus showing the depth of its lineup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the two teams are not good to deal with: "Osaka will be very difficult, we still have to as usual, carefully prepared."</seg>
<seg id="16">Now that the trumpet of the defending title has blown, the game has really entered the "white heat stage."</seg>
<seg id="17">On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above their opponents, only the final crunch, but also to see if the women's volleyball girls can play their normal level and release themselves on the court.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chirac ’ s Death ’ s Political Legacy</seg>
<seg id="2">26 local time, former French President Jacques Chirac passed away at the age of 86.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of unprecedented change, the French politician ’ s legacy of politics, when he was in office, is still worth our praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chirac has been president of France for 12 years in a highly personal way.</seg>
<seg id="5">He inherited both the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullist and his strong support for European integration, and was a representative of the “European dream. ”</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he is also a strong advocate of world multipolarity and multilateralism, a politician with a strategic vision.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is why the French media rated him as "France's outstanding representative on the world stage."</seg>
<seg id="8">One of Chirac's promising political decisions is to oppose the US-led war in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under his leadership, France joined Germany in fighting American pressure and was at the forefront of the anti-war.</seg>
<seg id="10">A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="11">As it turned out, Chirac ’ s warning was correct.</seg>
<seg id="12">At a time when European integration is mired in confusion and America ’ s unilateralism is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac ’ s strategic thinking and choices about international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was one of the advocates and creators of the “golden decade ” of China-France relations, and in 1995, when he was first elected president of France, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with a politician ’ s strategic vision.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.</seg>
<seg id="16">During Chirac ’ s administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields, such as aviation, nuclear and rail transport, made breakthrough progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chirac Initiative's Year of Chinese and French Culture has created a new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.</seg>
<seg id="18">Chirac's life has been particularly impressive for the love of Chinese culture.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to his Chinese diplomat, Chirac can memorize some of Li Bai and Du Fu's poems and even accurately judge the historical age of the Chinese Bronze Age.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Not to see the pyramids not really to Egypt, not to see the Terracotta Warriors not really to China" - this golden sentence is from Chirac.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political standing internationally," Chirac said in an interview with Xinhua reporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">But I am confident in China.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think China is a country with a long history of civilization and has enough experience to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and take on its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">I also believe that China's rejuvenation will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">The man is gone, but Chirac's political legacy and inspiration to the world will last forever.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Legislative Council Members join forces to oppose US approach to Hong Kong bill</seg>
<seg id="2">The Legislative Council of the HKSAR, part of the establishment of the Legislative Council, issued a joint statement on 27 December expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019" by the foreign committees of both houses of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="3">The statement, by the 40 establishment members of the Joint Agency, said that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are vested by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, and in different areas of the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, in the name of "Hong Kong, China" to sign bilateral cooperation and bilateral agreements with different countries and regions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and commercial ethics, and has been engaged in business with different countries and regions to participate in many relevant fields of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The statement said it was not necessary for the foreign committees of both houses of the United States to pass the bill, only to respond to the call of their Hong Kong agents as a means of violently intervening in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="7">The establishment lawmakers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hong Kong's fine rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the US passes this bill, in addition to fighting Hong Kong and the US itself, it will make China-US relations worse, with no benefit and damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">The statement said Hong Kong would, as always, unwaveringly implement the "one country, two systems" approach, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law and effectively fulfill its obligations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whether past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce.</seg>

<seg id="1">The two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="2">French President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France cannot "accept everyone," but at the same time try to "properly accept."</seg>
<seg id="3">Macron is trying to find a halfway line on immigration to slow the impact of the upcoming debate, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview on the sidelines of the General Debate of the General Assembly in New York, Macron said he hoped there would be a real "two-pronged" programme on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macron said: "If France wants to be able to properly accommodate (migrants), it cannot accept everyone."</seg>
<seg id="6">Macron cited four priorities of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting integration more efficiently; hosting and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who enter France illegally and are unfit to stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system is the most discussed topic in the past.</seg>
<seg id="8">Macron said he hoped to be able to "assess" the system but not remove it, but put some restrictions on it.</seg>
<seg id="9">After Macron ’ s remarks, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right “National Alliance, ” tweeted that Macron ’ s announcement was“ empty talk. ”</seg>
<seg id="10">Right-wing Republican Party member and Senate Speaker Ryan Rascher also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderating" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leftist Socialist Party MP Mr Varau believes France should "take on more and better" on immigration and criticised Macron for "manipulating" the issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in place for a year, has led to disagreements within the ruling party, but has not been able to appease right-wing opposition parties, the report</seg>
<seg id="13">In the next 2022 general election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of attacks on the far right, and Macron needs to make a difference on the issue, but also risk angering the ruling party's internal left.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lower house of France's National Assembly will reportedly debate immigration policy from September 30, while the Senate will debate it from October 2.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are signs that China's A shares are entering a "buyback wave," with many listed companies taking out "real gold and silver" to buy back company shares.</seg>
<seg id="2">As of 27 days, the total amount of repurchase and implementation of A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, same as below), far exceeding the previous year's data for the same period, a record high in the amount of repurchase of A-share shares, according to statistics from financial data service provider Oriental Wealth.</seg>
<seg id="3">In response, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mekorong Information Consulting Co. Ltd., said the overall valuation of the A-share market was low this year and that buying back shares at relatively low prices would help listed companies improve the efficiency of capital use, as well as the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market capitalization and abundant cash flow, which would help boost investor confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the continuous improvement of the share buyback system has also promoted the listed companies to actively buy back shares.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning of this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the implementation rules for repurchase of shares of listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for share buybacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented additional buyback programs have focused on infrastructure, real estate, information technology, and electronic equipment manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, from the amount of buyback payments, six listed companies have bought back more than 1 billion yuan this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among them, the top was Erie shares, which were bought back for more than $5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">What impact will listed companies' buyback have on the market?</seg>
<seg id="10">In an interview with Chinese news agency, Zhao Sijun, vice president of the School of Finance and Finance at Renmin University of China, said the buyback shows that listed companies have strong economic strength and better financial position, ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and responsible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="11">The former is based on the company's good business performance, the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.</seg>
<seg id="12">For capital markets, this is all at the heart of the underlying element.</seg>
<seg id="13">The repo of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock price of listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, the increment of the repurchase of shares in the A-share market is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan this year, according to the forecast number of share buybacks set by the A-share listed company as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average price of repurchased shares.</seg>

<seg id="5">Shouguang farmers have a tradition of planting vegetables, as well as a lesson in planting vegetables.</seg>

<seg id="7">Wang Bo Xiang research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make good circulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shouguang pioneered the establishment of the vegetable wholesale market and opened the prelude to the development of market economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Party cadres should take the lead, screw up, and lose all the county.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo Xiang, 17 Party members, such as Wang Lai Yi of Sanyuan Zhu Village, set up 17 winter warm vegetable sheds, which emerged as 17 "double million yuan households."</seg>
<seg id="11">Subsequently, the county set up a promotion team, under Wang Bo Xiang's mobilization, Wang Lai Yi in various townships tour guidance; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted, after which the vegetable sheds began to spread like a prairie fire across the county and even the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">For thousands of years, 1.6 million mu of land in Shoubei, in addition to saline and alkali beaches, is shallow sea beach.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local people live very hard.</seg>

<seg id="15">Wang Bo Xiang organized a hundred thousand people to fight the General Assembly, camped on the base beach, one dry is four or fifty days.</seg>
<seg id="16">Wang Bo Xiang and the leading cadres in the county eat and live on the site, like migrant workers, with strollers, and the common people see them all give their thumbs and admire their eyes..... when Shoubei developed 150,000 mu shrimp pool, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and developed "salt basin".</seg>

<seg id="18">During the meeting, the next "Weifang City 12 County City Industrial Economic Digital Comparison Table", at first glance industrial output value, Shouguang is still good, ranked fourth.</seg>
<seg id="19">But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output is only 190 million yuan, the bottom third.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wang Bo Xiang, with a group of more than 70 people, ran to the field to "change his mind."</seg>
<seg id="21">Back in less than a year, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.</seg>

<seg id="3">Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, by solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the immediate consequence being the challenge of the basic norms of international relations, the impact of the role of the United Nations, and the harm to the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">To address this challenge, it will take Central Africa to hold hands and shoulder to shoulder, and unity will have strength.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Security Council, Africa ’ s three countries speak in one voice, focusing on not just three votes, but the entire continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead other countries to follow suit, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2018, China has established a "3 + 1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Council to fully use it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Second, settle disputes by consultation.</seg>
<seg id="11">China has always advocated political settlement of hot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the complex problems on the Council ’ s agenda, particularly in Africa ’ s hot spots, are mostly the bane of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Together, we should use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation and so on.</seg>
<seg id="14">Third, rely on self-reliance.</seg>
<seg id="15">African countries and people know the problems of Africa best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">In dealing with Africa ’ s hot issues, the Council should focus on listening and respecting Africa ’ s wishes, play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">China is ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly promote the capacity building of independent and peaceful action in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="18">Fourth, development is fundamental.</seg>
<seg id="19">China and the African countries are developing countries, and we should insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other's chosen path of development.</seg>
<seg id="20">China is ready to work together to build the “One Belt, One Road ” with the AU Agenda , the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2030, and African development strategies to help African countries strengthen their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflict.</seg>
<seg id="21">Together, we should push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Ebola outbreak in Congo has re-erupted, and China has and will continue to do its utmost to provide human and material assistance within its means, and is ready to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize the United Nations and WHO to increase their assistance and play a good role in the United Nations stability mission in Congo (Kim).</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau "collapses," can he succeed in re-election</seg>
<seg id="2">This time, it was Trudeau who stumbled out of the "pit" that he dug himself a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="3">In recent days, Canadian media have revealed several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau dressing himself as a black figure.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is seen as an obvious act of racial discrimination, which is causing a stir in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="5">After it happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the Canadian public does not buy much.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trudeau was able to lift the stone and hit himself on the foot.</seg>
<seg id="8">As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the “anti-blackface movement ” from the US, Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been high-profile critics of the opposition or dissent in the party, and have repeatedly threatened that“ whoever makes this mistake should be expelled immediately. ”</seg>
<seg id="9">Simply put, this time, Trudeau stumbled out of a "big pit" that Trudeau himself dug a little bit out of.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was young and handsome and had a whirlwind of "political icons" when he first came out of the way.</seg>
<seg id="11">Originally a “political vegetarian, ” he took over as head of the federal Liberal Party in a surprise battle in the 2015 federal legislative election in Canada – the federal Liberal Party, which has more than half the seats in the federal lower house, and has gained valuable individual cabinet rights.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, Trudeau proposed many of the most impressive platforms and ideas, such as “ethnic and gender equality ”“ ecological environmental protection ” “economic revitalization, ” stressing the elimination of corruption and“ bad winds. ”</seg>
<seg id="13">However, for five years in office, he has been "high and low" in almost all of these aspects.</seg>
<seg id="14">Take the issue of "ethnic and gender equality," aside from the "blackface" incident, which followed a series of "lip service" on aboriginal issues, allowing Aboriginal groups and leaders to move the protest tent to the Congress Heights gate on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the fight against corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Lansing Incident".</seg>
<seg id="16">It was exposed, to his hometown construction company "Lan Wanling" major violations of favoritism fraud, to the department and officials in charge of the investigation, the latter "high praise."</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Trudeau has moved to anger at officials who have disclosed the ills – Wang Chauddy, the former mentioned, was the then-Canadian attorney general who pioneered the disclosure of the ills and directly handled the cases.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although there are doubts in the case itself, it is difficult to wash away the suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many observers point out that Trudeau ’ s five years in office have collapsed, mainly because of his own “pit, ” and that the biggest“ pit ” is “the tiger ’ s tail ” and“ the law, ” which is lenient.</seg>
<seg id="20">Canada's most authoritative Anguy-Reid poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who supported Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed equally poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who are still willing to vote for the federal Liberal Party are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and the ruling party leader.</seg>
<seg id="22">On October 21, when the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, can Trudeau repeat the repertoire of his sweeping victory five years ago?</seg>
<seg id="23">The answer may be one word: Hard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Jin-Ji development integration, all have profound influence and positive significance.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened on September 25.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is in a state of ultra-saturated operation and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's aviation service capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city with two airports in China. It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation affairs and Pudong Airport is dominated by international shipping aviation. In the future, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also provide more differentiated services to different domestic and international aviation operations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Daxing airport navigation, from the point of view of business development, for the capital airport more is a good impact.</seg>
<seg id="6">Capital Airport's passenger throughput exceeded 100 million passengers in 2018, the highest in the country, but there is still a significant lack of capacity, especially for international routes, compared with rapid business demand.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to better serve the needs of passenger travel and travel at home and abroad, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of cargo throughput in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, the two airport positioning does not overlap, targeting different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.</seg>
<seg id="9">From the economic level, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, easing the tension of Beijing's aviation capacity, accelerating the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake for the capital's aviation double-core operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">From a user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to focus on travel at the Capital Airport in the future, but also to reduce the number of problems caused by excessive concentration of routes.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the media's estimates of the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, if you start from the South Five Ring Road directly to Daxing Airport at high speed, you can get to Daxing Airport in 50 minutes. The price of oil is about 40 yuan, 15 yuan for high speed; and the choice of the rail transit subway line is 20 yuan, depending on the distance of Beijing and 30 yuan. It takes more than 20 minutes for West Station to Daxing Airport Station.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, there are a variety of transportation options for citizens to go to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a more reasonable range.</seg>
<seg id="13">From the point of view of trend development: Daxing airport is a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little distance from Beijing city, but it strengthens the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, which is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers can enjoy more international air line services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen in the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.</seg>
<seg id="15">Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to the new airport line directly to Daxing Airport in downtown Beijing, there are a number of highways connecting Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is like Guangdong Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other urban passengers can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via Guangzhou, Guangxi and other highways, and residents of Langfang, Xiongan New Area around Beijing will benefit from Daxing Airport to obtain convenient and efficient air services.</seg>
<seg id="17">It can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport has a profound impact and positive significance, not only on the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also to promote the development of the quality of Beijing's transportation industry, but also to promote the development of the quality of Beijing's transportation industry. Economic and trade development in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, for Daxing airport navigation, we should not only calculate the small account of the individual economically, but also the overall development of the big account.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed a lot of new growth and continued to grow, said Nguyen Dejian, deputy director of the Economic Committee of Vietnam's Congress.</seg>
<seg id="3">The forum focused on outstanding economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019, proposing measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the forum, representatives of the participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four topics, such as the impact of the economic development of 2019 and some of the FTA, some outstanding issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019 and projections and recommendations for economic and social development in Vietnam in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">Delegates generally agree that global economic growth has slowed in the first few months of 2019, with increased risks and challenges.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The International Monetary Fund has found that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, 70% of the world ’ s economies have stagnated in growth, Vietnam ’ s economic development has made many welcome achievements, with a smooth macroeconomic operation and effective control of inflation, with an average increase of 2.64% in consumer prices in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in nearly three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76 per cent, although lower than 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but still higher than the same period in 2011-2017.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a prediction of Vietnam's economic development trend in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said the Vietnamese economy showed higher growth momentum in 2019 against a backdrop of world economic turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="10">By 2020, Vietnam is expected to continue to maintain a basic macroeconomic stability, the implementation of various FTA will promote trade development, economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment have been further strengthened, and Vietnam's foreign export activities will decline as a result of trade frictions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and warning mechanism, actively find trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, find opportunities to expand new export markets and create convenience for foreign exports of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, the inflation rate is controlled at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2">If the 2009 local website forum is used as the original point, the 2019 cloud-based congress held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has passed a full decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the concept of a "cloud" to the practice of "cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies to support China's economic development, social management and public services in a decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new "colleague" loaded with Ariyun artificial intelligence was recently added to the quality inspector's side.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has no rest for 24 hours, more than twice the speed of identification, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the company's head, the "quality inspector" with the camera has studied more than 40,000 defective samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, which can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and classify defective battery tablets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company is just a microcosm of the transformation of cloud computing to help manufacturing today.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guide to the Implementation of the Enterprise on Cloud (2018-2020)" in 2018, proposing that by 2020, efforts to achieve a significant increase in cloud awareness and enthusiasm in enterprises, with a significant increase in the proportion and depth of applications.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, data-centric cloud computing has built bridges and opened the way for a digital economy with key elements of data, said Wang Jian, founder of Ariyun.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, over the past 10 years, China's cloud computing industry has been expanding.</seg>
<seg id="11">China's overall market for cloud computing reached  billion yuan in 2018, up 39.2 percent from 2017, according to the Cloud Computing Development White Paper (2019) released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to being the key technology to support the transformation of industry and the development of digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has unknowingly changed urban management and social life.</seg>
<seg id="13">At this year's cloud-based conference, the "urban brain", which has been unveiled for three years, remains a concern.</seg>
<seg id="14">At present, the urban brain has become the urban management center from the vehicle of transportation governance, and the relevant cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world, Ariyun said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, urban brains, through strong computing power, allow new urban management services such as "first stop pay" "real-time perception of the number of visits" "travel line design" to be realized.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the field of government services, with "a cloud" docking "one thing," the "palm office" "" palm business "synergy, cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through the government affairs cloud.</seg>
<seg id="18">As of September 11, the platform had covered more than 57 million resident populations and more than 15 million corporate units in the province, bringing in  billion pieces of data from governance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Be careful with plastic tea bags to make tea!</seg>
<seg id="2">A new Canadian study has found that a pack of plastic tea bags may release billions or even hundreds of millions of plastic particles, significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but there is no evidence so far that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans, according to the Central News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reportedly found that immersing a plastic tea bag into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag would release about 116 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nano-plastic particles into the cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">This number is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person estimates to ingest throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, found that researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packages in the Montero store and cafe, opened tea bags, washed them into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analyzed them with electronic microscopes and spectrometers.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 116 billion plastic particles, "several levels higher than the plastic load of other foods earlier."</seg>
<seg id="8">Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many tea bag brands still use plastic to seal their mouths, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the brand tea bags were no longer made of paper and used plastic, which the researchers tested.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, and researchers define these microplastics as ranging in size from 100 nanometers to 5 mm, mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, as well as tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers first found plastic particles in human faeces samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">To test the potential toxicity of tea bags to release plastic particles, the Canadian research team put water fleas in contaminated water and found that microplastics can affect the behavior of these water fleas and cause them to develop dysplasia.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence so far that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, WHO noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers speculate that the tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, possibly because these plastic tea bags are in contact with boiling water, and may break down or ooze toxic substances even when "edible grade" plastic is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.</seg>

<seg id="1">Guterres said the climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of the small island nation.</seg>
<seg id="2">There, a natural disaster would erode the development outcomes of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is illustrated by the hurricane-hit Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">About a quarter of SIDS live at an altitude of five metres or less.</seg>
<seg id="5">Relocation can seriously affect their social and lifestyle and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a climate action summit on Monday, small island countries worked together to achieve carbon neutralization and 100% renewable energy by 2030, so they once again led the world in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The climate crisis is piling up new injustices over old injustices," Guterres said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although small island developing countries contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these countries are in middle-income status, many are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">The world must act and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today ’ s high-level meeting adopted a political manifesto calling for help in managing disaster risk in SIDS, investing in climate-adaptable infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially those with heavily indebted middle-income countries, receive funding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the lifeline of the Earth - the oceans.</seg>
<seg id="13">The latest special report, released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, confirms that the oceans have suffered the "sobering" consequences of the climate crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the middle of this century, many regions may have experienced some extreme sea level rise that would have occurred only once a century each year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including maintaining fishing grounds in many island communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Small island countries also face high costs for transport, energy and infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="20">They rely heavily on a number of external markets, leaving them exposed to price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illicit trafficking in people, weapons and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere," Guterres said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The efforts of small island developing countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that can be learned around the world, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stressed that small island developing countries are special cases of sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id="25">They need long-term attention and investment from the international community as a whole.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Some of the overage migrant workers on the site are estimated to account for more than half.</seg>
<seg id="2">Where are the young workers now?</seg>
<seg id="3">There is no way to use so many 'old people' on the site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Recently, there are many overage migrant workers (over retirement age) on the construction site, Zou Qui, who works as an engineering contractor in the construction industry, lamented.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent times, the author of the university to carry out rain pollution diversion project, there are many migrant workers on campus, if careful observation, will find that there are many overage migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not "idle" for overage migrant workers to go out to work, but because they are "not idle", they have the helplessness and hardship of "having to do so" - whether saving money to solve their own pension and medical problems, or helping their children, driving these old people who should be "idle" to continue to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "old dependence" of overage migrant workers is not as easy as we think.</seg>
<seg id="8">Raising children, supporting the elderly, reading for their children, helping their children build buildings to buy cars, helping their children build homes, raising their grandchildren from generation to generation, and when these migrant workers have completed their “life tasks, ” money bags have been emptied and even a lot of debt, and most lack wealth accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order not to drag down children in order to accumulate more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "until they do not work."</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the new generation of migrant workers who are “post-80 ”“ post-90 ” and even “post-00 ” are reluctant to engage in difficult conditions, high-intensity secondary industries or low-end services, resulting in structural“ labor shortages, ” which lack attractive jobs that provide opportunities for overage migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the lack of skills, physical function and labor ability decline, many overage migrant workers are working with large intensity, low income, high risk and little protection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ability is a day, can earn a little more is a point, "can not idle" behind the survival plight of overage migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Solving the problem of unpaid wages and salaried wages, improving labor protection, reducing security risks, increasing labor income, and improving the survival of overage migrant workers, in addition to their "self-redemption", is also inseparable from public sector institutional protection and humanistic care.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some scholars point out that overage migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve problems such as their pension and medical care, and they must feed their families through other means.</seg>
<seg id="15">It helps us to better understand the love and pain of overage migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Seeing the backs of overage migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back to the countryside to really achieve "old things," requires the public sector, markets, and society to share responsibility in benign interactions and need to work together.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mr Chermezov said Russia would not export the system for the next five years because "the first thing is to supply its own military will be export production thereafter."</seg>
<seg id="2">This approach is entirely consistent with international practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">Major producers of weapons and military equipment always secure their own defense needs first, before they handle export orders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier, General Yuri Greshoff, deputy commander in chief of Russia's air force, said the development of the system was about to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond - Antai" air sky defense of Consen.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a new generation of air defense systems, using the working principle used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamic targets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles five times the speed of sound, and even targets near space.</seg>
<seg id="9">This weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems into a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sergei Cheryazov expressed particular concern about the S-400.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but Russian forces also need it, including in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The S-400 air defense system enters the Arctic air defense mission.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the September 15 news, the modification of the S-400 air defense missile system by the New Territories Arctic Air Defense Mission has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is not Russia's militarization in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Russian Defense Ministry said it was entirely a process within the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the strategic direction to the north.</seg>
<seg id="16">"With the transition to a new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly," the Russian Uttar Fleet Information Service said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system has been successful in its use in extreme North and Arctic regions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The officers and soldiers of the Air Defense Mission have trained the new system and are ready to enter combat duty.</seg>
<seg id="19">Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, part of it is still in place.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it comes to air defense, it must have weapons that can destroy all kinds of air targets, whether it is the target of high speed flight outside the height layer or the "leaky fish" close to the protected facility.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to public sources, the S-400 "Triumph" system, developed by the Golden Diamond-Antelope air defense, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air assault weapons.</seg>
<seg id="22">The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometres per second at a distance of 60 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia has never hidden that it will deploy air defense forces in the extreme north to ensure the airspace of the northern sea road.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not long ago, the first 12 sets of "Tor" -M2DT "air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen air defense systems in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Toll" force would expand to a complete brigade building in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">Combined with the new S-400 remote system deployed on the islands and the Kola Peninsula and the "Pantir" -SA short-range system deployed in the extreme north, these advanced air defense weapons strongly defend Russia's polar skies.</seg>
<seg id="27">Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will be difficult to break through this defence.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.</seg>
<seg id="2">As a Russian store operator, Russian-made companies focus on selling Russian goods in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">The largest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, , Pindudoo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunction Instant Communications Software Microcredit (WeChat), have online stores and have their own retail platforms on Epiduind.com and Russian.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Russian Export Center will work with Russia to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards and screen virtual shelf products companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The store plans to open by the end of the year and install products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Russian Export Center, China's e-commerce platform has a total monthly visit of up to 1 billion times.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, with more than $1 billion in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the framework of a global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new store will display goods from businesses with sales of at least 500 million rubles, according to Alexei Khotnikov.</seg>
<seg id="10">To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles in sales are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, viewing our goods as high quality and green environmental protection products, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying, Khotnikov said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We are ambitious and have launched 500 businesses through this store in three years," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, the platform will also serve the products of Russian Far East enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned rather than a private institution," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the Department of Trade Policy at Russia's Plevneliev Economic University.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I don't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods in the market," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He believes the project will likely not be truly implemented, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian companies has been released on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, both in China and in other countries, according to Russian news agencies.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, there is a model for working with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian Export Center at the Second China International Imports Expo in Shanghai in November will also serve as an organization for Russian companies to participate in industry exhibitions and business projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square meter exhibition hall, where it will also be the center of business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, push meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="22">About 50 applications have now been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="23">"In addition to the agricultural booth, we will certainly hold a business meeting to arrange direct links between entrepreneurs," the Russian Export Center Information Service said.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure dozens of special meetings are arranged for them," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, the fair will host master classes, cooking competitions and "Exploring the Shanghai Station of Russian Food" projects of Russian famous chefs cooking Russian food tasting sessions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xinhua Insight: Unswerving to take our own path</seg>
<seg id="2">The White Paper on China and the World in the New Era, released on May 27, answered: For 70 years, China ’ s development has been successful, the root cause is that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and have followed it unswervingly.</seg>
<seg id="3">China is the choice of history and the choice of the people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since modern times, in the environment of poverty and weakness and internal distress, generations of benevolent volunteers have sought to find the way to save the country and save the people.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the imperial system, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all thought and tried, the result is not working."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was not until the Chinese Communist Party, with the new China, that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist road with Chinese characteristics in practice.</seg>
<seg id="7">This road out of China is the happy road of the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and all countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is because, on the right path, China can do its thing well in order to become the world ’ s second-largest economy and the country that contributes the most to global economic growth in order to benefit the world in its own development.</seg>
<seg id="9">As the white paper points out, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and adapt to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.</seg>
<seg id="10">Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish it more.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese understand the reason of the northern brier of the South Orange, understand that it is not necessarily suitable for others, only suitable for themselves is the best.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is with this road confidence and strategic determination that China has created a remarkable miracle.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the tortuous process of human progress, the "historical conclusion" has been famous for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics heralds the end of "historical conclusion," the collapse of "Chinese collapse theory" and the failure of "socialist failure theory."</seg>
<seg id="15">China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve national prosperity and strong people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and reference for countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate development and maintain their independence, and to follow the path that meets their national conditions.</seg>
<seg id="16">The world is colorful.</seg>
<seg id="17">China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path suitable for their national conditions.</seg>
<seg id="18">China does not "enter" the foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly take its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges of governance and governance with countries, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.</seg>

<seg id="1">It comes after the Fair Work Commission found that a Woolworths supermarket boss who sacked a 66-year-old female worker by text message for preferring to hire staff from Asian backgrounds was slammed as "disgraceful."</seg>
<seg id="2">The council said the way Ms Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated staff was "grossly unfair" and could have violated anti-discrimination laws.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang, who took over the shop in 2016, had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case, the commission's deputy chairman, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the internet and found "some of the job ads Mr. Wang used to post at various Australian Chinese employment forums."</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the job requirements listed in the posts, one said "first choice Asian lady" and the other said "first choice Asian employee."</seg>
<seg id="6">A third post said he was "more inclined to go overseas (sic)."</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Wang fired Ms Ayton in April this year via text message, later claiming it was due to her absence and a small amount of cash missing from $5.10 to $30 when the cashier allegedly appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr Sams said Mr Wang's case for firing Ms Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">She has been absent for only one shift in three years, with a "missing amount" totaling several Australian dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said Ms Ayton's dismissal had "virtually nothing to do with her behaviour or performance."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In my opinion, supported by evidence of a job advertisement released by Mr. Wang, the real motivation for the defense to fire her was his willingness to hire staff with an Asian background," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, it is illegal for Mr. Wang's actions to ostensibly constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws and / or dismissal of applicants, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr Wang to consider restoring her post in light of Mr Wang's "appalling" treatment of Ms Ayton.</seg>
<seg id="14">He should consider paying damages to Ms Ayton, who is a casual worker and is paid A $26 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given the potential violation of anti-discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said he would refer his own rulings and documents to committee directors to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be passed to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said Mr Wang had not given Ms Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged dismissal of her grounds.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I believe that the respondent took an irredeemably unjust and biased process to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang" waited "for this opportunity, which he believes would 'prove' that the termination of the employment of the applicant was justified," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He was wrong... the defector completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her when he expelled the applicant, and it was shocking that he was rude and extremely unjust for perfunctory conduct," the statement read.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, "it is important to be frank that any decent employer would not dismiss employees in an extremely unfair and perfunctory manner as acknowledged in this case."</seg>
<seg id="20">"It's disgraceful and it's extremely unfair," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Listed companies buy back more than 100 billion yuan in year - Xinhua</seg>
<seg id="2">In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have frequently bought back shares in the past two years, hoping to pass on the information that the company's value is undervalued to the market, thereby stabilizing the share price and boosting investor confidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dongfang Wealth Choice data show that in 2017, listed companies spent 7.9 billion yuan on buybacks, jumped to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of buybacks by A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, a record high in repurchases of A-shares, and far more than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="4">From the purpose of the buyback, the company's repo shares appear to be the same as the increase of major shareholders, but there are great differences in the implementation of the subject, source of funds, repurchase uses, the equity of the stock itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mekorong Information Consulting Co. Ltd., told the Securities Daily that in November 2018, the "Views on Supporting the Repo of Shares of Listed Companies", aimed at the narrower scope of share buybacks, complex decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems, began to improve the repo of shares from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued the Implementation Rules for the Repo of Shares of Listed Companies, which broadened the source of buyback funds for listed companies, streamlined implementation procedures, guided improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership plans.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the introduction of the opinion, the operation of the listed company to buy back shares has more applicable circumstances, the repo process is simpler and the share buyback enthusiasm is greater.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buying shares in relatively low positions is also conducive to the use of funds by listed companies, thus increasing the level of earnings per share, raising net asset yields and easing the pressure on the company's profitability indicators.</seg>
<seg id="9">Compared with the increase of major shareholders, the significance of repo shares of listed companies is greater, also reflects the active market value management willingness and cash flow of listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xu Yang believes that the undervalued stock price is the main factor in the buyback of listed companies, the company's share price is no longer able to reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but cannot blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies and specific operating conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Listed companies with massive repo behavior at least show the company's development confidence and financial strength.</seg>
<seg id="12">The enthusiasm for buyback among A-share listed companies is heating up and normalizing repo behavior, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share buybacks this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the buyback market.</seg>
<seg id="13">China Ping An recently disclosed the repo progress, saying that the company has bought back  million shares of A shares, or 0.315% of the company's total equity, and has paid a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), and that the buyback will be fully used in employee shareholding plans, including but not limited to the company's shareholder meeting plan.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erie shares have paid 57.92 billion yuan for share buybacks and have been adjusted for the purpose of repurchase shares in the near future, changing from the original plan to "buy back all shares as a source of later equity incentives" to "buy back 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares are used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining  million will be used to reduce the registered capital."</seg>
<seg id="15">Erie said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help to further enhance the level of earnings per share and effectively improve the return on investment of the company's shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="16">TCL Group issued a buyback progress announcement on September 25, showing that TCL Group had bought back 3.59 percent of the company's shares at a cost of 16.5 billion yuan.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Changsha to create the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, in the current fashionable words, is to create "the strongest surface."</seg>
<seg id="3">As an inland provincial capital city, Changsha called out this rhetoric, what is the base?</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the power of bullying.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four engineering machinery enterprises that participated in the dialogue, all of them, covered the fields of sky, underground, sea and land: the intelligent light aircraft of the mountain river, the concrete conveyor pump of the Zhongzhong Branch, the whole ground crane of the Trinity Heavy Industries, the tunnel shield machine of the iron construction, its "hard power".</seg>
<seg id="6">Once upon a time, China had little say in the field of engineering machinery and manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Time Shiyi, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go out" two-wheel drive, take the "One Belt and Road" initiative of the east wind, buy, merge, set up factories and so on, one leap into the global engineering machinery industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among them, Trinity Heavy Industries, CUHK, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, Mountain River Intelligent and other engineering machinery leading enterprises, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, have led the same enterprises significantly.</seg>

<seg id="12">In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many well-known international engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises fell down, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises regarded "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only in the past, but also more robust.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the basis of the stars of the moon, the government and enterprises together.</seg>
<seg id="14">The development of superior industries requires both enterprising enterprises and active government action.</seg>
<seg id="15">Changsha has a reputation as the "capital of engineering machinery" because it converges the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of related industrial clusters, and reduces the cost of R  D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Good business ecology, let the engineering machinery and manufacturing enterprises poured in.</seg>
<seg id="17">History has pushed Changsha to the front desk of the leading level of engineering machinery in the world.</seg>
<seg id="18">Whether the government, enterprises, and even related production and research enterprises, and other links, should seize the opportunity, homeward, bite the target, continue to develop strength, and contribute to the construction of the manufacturing power of Hunan.</seg>

<seg id="2">September autumn rendering of the loess plateau.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the Yimin Cultivation Professional Cooperative in the town of Stagecoach, 58-year-old villager Xia Vili filled the slot in the sheep circle with a final shovel of grass, stood at the edge of the trough, watching the white lake sheep chew.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's good to eat, and when autumn and winter are full of fat, it can sell for a good price."</seg>
<seg id="5">He said he fed the sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, regularly cleaning, sterilizing, carefully waiting to not neglect.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shavili kept sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work in a cooperative, to know how rough it used to be.</seg>
<seg id="7">Xia Wei is the village of Xia Shui Chi in Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.</seg>
<seg id="8">His neighbors are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of keeping sheep, poor quality of sheep, small outputs.</seg>
<seg id="9">In June, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to shift.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xhavili spent all day studying farming, because he was always holding his heart.</seg>
<seg id="11">The people who enter the stock are poor, they all trust the sheep to the cooperative, the end of the year can pay dividends, sell the price, but all expect him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to fight epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, became one of the few farming "good style" in the village.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yimin Cultivation Professional Cooperatives are a standardised cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.</seg>
<seg id="14">Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that standardised sheep sheds are very door-to-door.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Wool is thick and easy to breed bacteria, lake sheep can't stay in muggy and wet places, sheep sheds must be built on three sides of the trench, and have to be equipped with a fan to ventilate the heat."</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to vaccinate, Zou Tao said, it is also necessary to regularly sterilize the sheep shed spray and give the sheep three to four anti-epidemic needles in the first quarter.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to living well, "Little Fat Sheep" has to eat grass mixed with silage corn, wheat grass, alfalfa, and has enough broad "playground" to stretch its bones.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperative adopts the method of hosting substitutes to guide local farmers to put good species of lake sheep here, raise, manage and sell them uniformly, and realize breeding, scientific, standardization and intensive farming.</seg>
<seg id="19">Today, 140 poor households with sheep are paid more than 6,000 yuan per household each year, and four people working in the cooperative work for poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="20">From "full mountain grazing" to "precise feeding," from "local mating" to "artificial insemination," from "looking at body shape, touching belly" to "doing B supero".... in Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat and sheep farming is not just a transformation of feeding methods, "dragon enterprises + cooperative + farmers have overcome the traditional landscape of sheep farming and sheep farming. The poor days are getting better because of the modernization of sheep.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the market price is weak, Zou Tao said, local leading company Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd. will buy at the bottom of the market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk.</seg>
<seg id="22">Xu Jianfeng, general adviser to Zhongsheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Gansu Province, said that enterprises have led more and more poor households to "sheep Sutra" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, bid acquisition and unified processing and sales services for poor households.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a steady increase in income through "joining" the forage farming, breeding, scale farming, slaughter division, market sales.</seg>
<seg id="24">Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and pastoral fault zone, forage resources are rich.</seg>
<seg id="25">At present, there are 913 meat and sheep scale farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million meat and sheep breeders, and two processing production lines of 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter, and sheep are becoming the "leader" of poverty alleviation in the industry.</seg>

<seg id="2">Paris (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than €10 billion ($109 billion) next year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive a depressed economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Introducing France's 2020 budget, Le Maire said the European Central Bank's latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity for governments in member states with capacity to increase investment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The European Central Bank cut interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to restart purchases to drive down borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient," Le Maire told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Germany needs to invest, needs it now, the sooner the better. Don't wait for the situation to deteriorate before acting," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.</seg>
<seg id="8">France has already implemented tax cuts of more than €10 billion this year, giving France a big boost to economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the global economy has lost momentum and the export-dependent German economy has borne the brunt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Le Maire noted that the tax burden on French households will be reduced by €9.3 billion next year, including €5 billion in income tax relief.</seg>

<seg id="1">Study: U.S. National Health Diet Index up slightly but still challenging - CUHK</seg>
<seg id="2">(Reuters Health) - The U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown modestly in 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new study in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">But when the full score is 100, it's not worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the study's authors, Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans still eat too much food that could trigger diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, among the most common diseases among U.S. nationals.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study was published online 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The study was based on findings from a health survey of 4.4 million adults conducted by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Notable dietary challenges remain despite significant improvements," the authors wrote.</seg>
<seg id="9">The challenges are known to include reducing Americans' intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The biggest improvement in the nation's diet is the reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.</seg>
<seg id="12">Officials believe that the amount of added sugar should be less than 10% in a daily diet.</seg>
<seg id="13">For reasons of lower sugar intake, the researchers believe it is related to a decrease in people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.</seg>
<seg id="14">U.S. adults have a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain categories.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the 2016 data shows that these foods still account for less than 5 percent of their daily diet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and reduced consumption of fruit juice, which leads to lower carbohydrate intake, Zhang said they still account for up to 42 percent of daily calories, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study is based on a biennial survey of personal health that will allow adults to recall the foods they have eaten in the past 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="19">The government's guidelines for Americans' diets recommend that people adopt a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">The guidelines state that people should eat more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, seeds that can provide protein.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the study period, the number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled, by more than 7%, and obesity increased for many years between the surveys – about 70% of American adults are overweight or obese today.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among U.S. nationals.</seg>

<seg id="1">China railway tunnel shaft's deepest record is refreshed</seg>
<seg id="2">After more than 1,200 days of round-the-clock construction, the construction of the No. 1 shaft of the Great (Li) Railway High Lai Gong Mountain Tunnel was completed on September 27, and the depth of the well reached  59 meters below the ground, breaking the record of the Chinese railway tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="3">The  km long DaRi Railway High Lai Gong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan, the tunnel from the west bank of the Nangjiang River across the High Lai Gong Mountain Mountains, the longest single tunnel in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones and is at a maximum depth of  meters, because it covers almost all of the bad geology and major risks that tunnel construction may encounter, the High Levien Mountain Tunnel is known as the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shaft is the most important auxiliary pit road of the High Lai Gong Mountain Tunnel. It is an important task to increase the operating surface to realize the "short strike of the long tunnel" and the ventilation of the later railway operation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The successful excavation of the No. 1 shaft to the bottom of the well marks the official entry into the horizontal tunnel construction of the High Lai Gong Mountain Tunnel. After the excavation and equipment replacement of the bottom of the well, four operating surfaces can be added under the well to speed up the opening of the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because the granite formation is more fractured, can not stop the water, from top to bottom flow, basically how deep the water pressure is."</seg>
<seg id="8">Shi Jingzhao, Chief Engineer of the Dali Railway Project Department of the Central Rail Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that in the construction of the shaft, there have been many accidents such as water and collapse, and the construction party invited experts to take the pulse on the site and more than 20 research and treatment options.</seg>
<seg id="9">"When the water in the shaft is highest, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour, more than 700 meters deep at the bottom of the well, and the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep at the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="10">"If the drainage is not pumped in time, one hour will flood the well by 10 metres, we will spend almost 85 per cent of our time on water treatment and 15 per cent of our time on digging," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to overcome the geologic problems such as longitudinal joints development, water inrush and water-rich granite in No. 1 shaft, the tunnel construction uses a system of water treatment measures combined with "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the risk of construction.</seg>
<seg id="12">After many improvements, the construction of No. 1 shaft has formed a mechanized water line such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system, winch lift system, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the end, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation of a depth of  59 meters.</seg>
<seg id="14">The DaRi railway is 330 kilometers long and is an important part of the China-Myanmar international channel and an important transportation infrastructure for the construction of the "One Belt and Road".</seg>
<seg id="15">After the completion of the train, Dali to Ruili will be reduced from 6 hours on the road to 2 hours, will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan region, and will promote the friendly exchanges between China and South Asian countries in economic and trade cooperation and personnel.</seg>

<seg id="3">Because of the poor family of the accused, the procuratorial organs opened alternative labor compensation ecological restoration costs and realized the organic unity of legal effect and social effect.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wang Zhongliang, deputy attorney general of the Baokang County Prosecutor's Office, said on Friday that through three months of alternative labor such as "duty patrol", the defendant, Zhou Mou, had established deep feelings with wild macaques and was deeply responsible for the previous animal hunting.</seg>
<seg id="5">On June 21 this year, the Baokang County Prosecutor's Office filed a criminal incidental civil public interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources, which was publicly heard in the county court and sentenced in court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defendant, Zhou Mou, was sentenced to three years in prison, four years of probation, and fined 3,000 yuan, while ordered to compensate him for ecological resources environmental damage repair costs of $.</seg>
<seg id="7">After investigation, Zhou began to set up the grid at the cliff in late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wild animals, including gazelle, small suede, mulberry deer, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="8">The gazelle belongs to the country's secondary endangered wildlife conservation animals, and small suede and capuchin deer are listed on the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the court hearing, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and behavior and was willing to bear civil liability.</seg>
<seg id="10">But given the poor economic situation in Zhou's home, under the coordination of the Paukang County Prosecutor's Office, the local village committee, Lin Station and Zhou Mou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation ecological restoration costs: namely, Zhou Mou through the training of macaque monkeys in the village macaque monkey reserve for a year, duty to patrol mountains and forest protection to provide a public welfare service.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the prosecutor's recommendation, the court said it approved that Zhou's probation should be carried out while actively fulfilling his obligation to "replace labor to compensate for ecological restoration costs."</seg>
<seg id="12">At present, Zhou has been volunteering in the macaque monkey reserve for three months, touring the mountain actively and performing well.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the Paukang County Prosecutor's Office has integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behavior in practice. The scientific application of procuratorial advice, investigation supervision and litigation supervision has minimized the damage caused to the ecological environment by criminal acts through judicial means.</seg>

<seg id="2">In warm applause and grand music, Xu Xiang, head of the Ant Forest project, and user representative Shen Jun Liang took the podium and took the trophy from the host for the 2019 United Nations "Earth Guard Award.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2019 Earth Defender Awards ceremony was held in New York, US, on May 26, with the Ant Forest project, which uses mobile phone programs to drive hundreds of millions of people into environmental action, winning the award for "Motivation and Action."</seg>
<seg id="4">A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced a list of awards at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people attending the awards ceremony that day were still thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that has allowed hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment, "said Yinghe Anunsheng, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, in an interview with Xinhua.</seg>
<seg id="6">It uses technology to connect people to the environment and allow each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ant Forest," launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Gold) on the Alipay platform in August 2016, users save "green energy" in their mobile phones by documenting green travel in their daily lives, paying utilities online, and other low-carbon actions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each time the user develops a virtual tree, the "ant forest" and the pro bono partner will plant a real tree in the desertification area.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users had accumulated a carbon reduction of  million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Earth Defender Award, awarded on the same day by Costa Rica for its national environmental efforts, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to the prize, praised the contribution of Ant Forest on the scene and "can inspire so many people to participate in green action."</seg>
<seg id="11">Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive of Ant Gold, said the Earth Defender Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, an honor that belongs to all participants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Jing said the "ant forest" had affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the next three years was to drive one billion people around the world into low-carbon action.</seg>
<seg id="14">While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to make farmers' incomes more from green mountains and mountains.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to increase their income through agricultural product development projects, electronic business platforms and so on.</seg>
<seg id="16">The digital technology based public welfare environmental model created by Ant Forest has also been successfully put out to sea and used by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In June, the largest "electronic wallet" GCash in the Philippines launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the report, GCash will join hands with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the Environmental Public Interest Organization, and plans to plant 3.65 million trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Earth Defender Award is the United Nations' highest award in the field of environmental protection, awarded annually.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Ant Forest" won the award for the third year in a row, following the construction of the Selham Dam forest site in China, the "Millennium Village Demonstration and Wan Village Correction" project in Zhejiang Province, China.</seg>

<seg id="1">Economic and trade frictions affect the US economy "report card."</seg>
<seg id="2">The US economy ’ s “report card ” for the second quarter of this year showed that US gross domestic product growth slowed significantly from the previous quarter, driven by a sharp decline in private-sector investment and exports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Analysts say economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring are the main reasons for the decline in private-sector investment and exports in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The final revision, released by the Commerce Department on May 26, showed U.S. GDP grew 2 percent in the second quarter at an annual rate, in line with earlier revised data, but significantly lower than 3.1 percent in the first quarter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Consumer growth became the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter, the data showed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy, rose 4.6% in the quarter, pulling the economy up by 3.03 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, government consumer spending and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ainslie Macroeconomic Consulting, said private sector investment had not only failed to sustain last year's growth, but had fallen sharply because of rising economic and trade frictions and uncertainty that had hit corporate confidence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Knapp believes US corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downward trend next year amid policy uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="11">Analysts believe that while consumer growth has formed a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the outlook for US consumption.</seg>
<seg id="12">Richard Curtin, the head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said in a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in a year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="13">Analysts generally agree that the US economy will continue to slow in the future.</seg>
<seg id="14">But some experts say the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions are eased.</seg>
<seg id="15">Keen Birch, a global economist at the British Economist think tank, expects the US economy to continue its gradual decline this year, at a slower pace than in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi predicted that the U.S. economy would grow at 2.3 percent this year and slow further to 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic and trade frictions no longer continue to escalate.</seg>
<seg id="17">The biggest concern for companies at the moment is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring, and if economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the industrial sector will perform much better than it is now, according to Ellen Harzen, investment manager at Putnam Investment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Matt Merley, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions are still "the top issue" and the main reason for this year's sharp volatility in US capital markets, and whether economic and trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is the embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights and an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 27, at the fifteenth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the first local regulation of a comprehensive system enacted by the provincial authorities in Ningxia to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be formally implemented from November 1, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is understood that the Regulations adopted were revised on the basis of the Measures on the Implementation of the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests of the People's Republic of China in Ningxia in 2007. They are divided into nine chapters 65, including general rules, political rights, cultural education rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, family rights, legal rights, legal rights and rights.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of the introduction of shared parental leave for couples, which is pioneered in the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">In April, the Council of State's Office issued the Guidance Note on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children Under 3.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the course of the revision of the Ordinance, Ningxia innovated to encourage employers to give couples with children between the ages of zero and three to give them ten days of shared parental leave each year.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and protections for female minors.</seg>
<seg id="10">In section 43 of the Regulations, the latest legislative achievements of China's current civil code personality rights are absorbed, and the composition of sexual harassment, the main body and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment are refined.</seg>
<seg id="11">Article 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits vicious incidents of sexual assault against girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention efforts to become a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In view of the right of women to know and deal with the common property of married families, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates that women's right to know common property and the obligation of property registration institutions and related subjects to provide solid institutional support for women's rights.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, in response to social hot-button issues, sexism in employment, Article 26 of the Ordinance not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders a ban on indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest joint interview practice experience, enhances the discipline of sexist violations, and more vigorously defends women's legitimate rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recent years, the joint public inspection department and civil affairs department of Ningxia Women's Federation have been effective in promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in the mediation and anti-domestic violence of marital and family conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Ordinance summarizes and promotes this, encourages the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and requires people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional protection and support through the purchase of services.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australia's new state passed the legalisation of abortion on September 26, local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, the Australian Network reported.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is understood the bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with serious divisions within the Australian Liberal Party since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="3">After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian New State Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by 26 votes to 14, making it the third longest bill in the New State Senate to consider it, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="4">26, the morning after a final vote in the state's House of Representatives to legalize abortion in the new state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bill allows women to terminate a pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation and, if two doctors agree, a woman is also allowed to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Senate passed an amendment on the night of 25 that doctors can seek advice from a multidisciplinary panel of the hospital's advisory committee before performing abortion for a woman 22 weeks pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, amendments passed by the Senate include that doctors must provide appropriate care for babies who survive the termination of a pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Previously, the new state governor, Berejiklian, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and Berejiklian had repeatedly stepped in to secure more debate time for the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Berejiklian defended his absentee ballot, saying: "I need to take the time to run the whole new state."</seg>
<seg id="10">Liberal MP Davies is understood to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, having threatened to withdraw from the new state government and said the bill had triggered a "government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="11">But after that, Davis made a concession.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The contents of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill, which was presented to the House on the morning of 26, actually provide more safeguards for women, doctors," Davis said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred $ billion to enrich the social security fund.</seg>
<seg id="2">As of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about  billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Liu Kun made the remarks at the task deployment meeting of the state-owned capital enrichment social security fund jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Security of Human Resources and the SASAC on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system. It is the full embodiment of the intergenerational equity of state-owned enterprises' development achievements and basic endowment insurance system. It is a policy measure based on the current and long-term policy measures."</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Programme for Transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the Social Security Fund, requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Liu Kun, the work ahead of the transfer has achieved positive results.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, with the total transfer of state-owned capital of about  billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions by the Ministry of Finance to perform the functions of the funders has been basically completed.</seg>

<seg id="1">The national capital transfer to enrich the social security fund - from the starting point of "enrich the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for the pension security.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but opens the "mathematical addition".</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Services, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities and Futures Commission jointly issued the "Notice on the Comprehensive Pushing aside some of the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund".</seg>
<seg id="4">After the documents were released, departments such as the Treasury Department were quick to implement them.</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of its stake in ICBC and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with two equity transfers worth more than $11.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the regulations, the underwriters such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to gain, dispose and know the rights of the state-owned equity.</seg>
<seg id="7">ICBC and Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in the controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this regard, the author believes that similar state-owned enterprise equity transfer is not a simple change of ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of the "addition operation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first step in the transfer of national capital to social security is, naturally, to reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by all, and to share the achievements of development for all.</seg>
<seg id="10">After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy, and the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously realized to do the best and do the strong.</seg>
<seg id="12">On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to push aside some of the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ministry of Finance immediately said that in conjunction with the relevant departments, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, it will fully push aside some of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the intergenerational fairness of the basic endowment insurance system and the development of state-owned enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second step of the transfer "addition result" is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the pension social security system.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the aging population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national capital, which is the subject of transfer, has the ability to continue to profit and distribute dividends, not only can effectively replenish the social security fund, but also provides the source for the social security fund.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some estimates show that each transfer of 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital, can support the enterprise basic endowment insurance deposit rate cut by 1 percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third step of the rotation, the "addition result," is to increase the stabilizer for the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="18">This transfer undertakes the main body to obtain the income of the way is "dividends mainly, the operation is auxiliary."</seg>
<seg id="19">As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund is really based on the proceeds of equity dividends.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, as a value investor in the capital market, Social Security Fund has strong capital operation ability.</seg>
<seg id="21">For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, promote the business level and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the social security fund, as a vane of investment, the promotion of the weight of ownership, is conducive to further enhance its influence in the market and play the role of "stabilizer" in the market.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it is also helpful to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and guide investors to invest rationally and value.</seg>

<seg id="2">26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has once again violated the Iran nuclear deal by using advanced centrifuges to create enriched uranium, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Sept. 27, according to the Central News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3">Iran is reportedly gradually violating the limits of the Iran nuclear deal in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="4">Iran suspended two other commitments in July, with the stock of enriched uranium remaining below 300 kilograms and the purity of enriched uranium not exceeding 3.67 percent, and now moving further.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under the nuclear deal, Iran can only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.</seg>
<seg id="6">If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the use of nuclear bombs.</seg>
<seg id="7">"On September 25, the agency has confirmed that Iran is developing advanced centrifuges of model 2, model 3... are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to Member States on May 26, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the (Natanz enriched uranium) facility."</seg>

<seg id="2">(New China 70 years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and challenge to the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The white paper states that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">The white paper says that as China's comprehensive national strength and international influence have risen rapidly, some people around the world are worried that China will go the way of "national strength," and some have put forward what they call "China's threat."</seg>
<seg id="5">This has both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, psychological imbalances caused by strength reduction, and intentional distortions that defend their vested interests.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of the people of all countries to realize the country's prosperity and strength, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.</seg>
<seg id="7">"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world."</seg>
<seg id="8">The white paper notes that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's technological innovation has injected new kinetic energy into world economic growth, and the stabilizer and power source role of China's economy in the future is more prominent.</seg>
<seg id="9">At present, the world economy is underpowered and the robust Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">China's economy is shifting from rapid growth to high quality development, with new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and agricultural modernization accelerating, economic structure deep adjustment, industrial optimization and continuous upgrading, and new economic growth points emerging.</seg>
<seg id="11">"By 2040, China and the rest of the world ’ s economies are on track to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the global economy, and stronger cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create great economic value," the McKinsey Global Research Institute report said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The white paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.</seg>
<seg id="13">China, which has a more stable economic operation, a higher quality of growth and a promising future for growth, is a long-term positive for world economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14">Think of China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" to try to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains, and make it "decoupled" from the world economy, neither feasible nor harmful.</seg>
<seg id="15">The white paper notes that opening up to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share the “Chinese dividend. ”</seg>
<seg id="16">China is unswervingly pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, achieving greater strength and higher levels of opening-up, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and more large-scale "go out" to benefit more countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Open should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, on one side. ”</seg>
<seg id="18">Mutual benefits can last for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="19">The white paper says China has pledged to continue to expand imports, relax market access, improve the business environment and strengthen intellectual property protection, and other countries should open up and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Only by moving forward can we create an open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a community of mutually beneficial and win-win interests.</seg>
<seg id="21">The white paper notes that China provides more public goods to the international community.</seg>
<seg id="22">Including promoting high-quality co-construction of the "One Belt and Road", building multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively carrying out external assistance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"China's development has benefited from the international community and has never forgotten to give back to the international family and provide more and better public products to the international community."</seg>

<seg id="1">Demonstration as president steps down in Egypt as authorities show strong crackdown</seg>
<seg id="2">The Twitter-themed hashtag and social media are vigorously advocating for the Egyptian masses to take to the streets today to peacefully appeal to President Sisi to step down.</seg>
<seg id="3">But authorities have shown an intention to use force to suppress it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since Sisi, then the head of the military, seized power in a military coup in 2013, dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="5">The British Guardian reports that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo NGO, has noted that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since a rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Sisi to step down.</seg>
<seg id="6">Corruption allegations surrounding Sisi and his family's profligate pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to take to the streets with 20 days to go.</seg>
<seg id="7">Egypt's Interior Ministry said firmly yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be decisive and never soft.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cairo's downtown is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square, Egypt's revolutionary tipping point, in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="9">Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social sage, including professor of political science at Cairo University and prominent columnist Nafat.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I have no doubt that continuing to make Sisi's absolute rule will cause disaster," he tweeted on 24.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately."</seg>
<seg id="12">Hosni, who served as a spokesman for Anan, Egypt's former military chief of staff, was in custody before Nafat's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="14">The chairman of the Constitutional Party, Davutoglu, is also in custody.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysts and political figures argue that sweeping dissent reflects government instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and middle classes are intensifying.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The capture highlights the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how scared it is," said Ayman Nour, the opposition leader who once competed for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Because the economy has been muddled by him, combined with widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to convey a clear message to important generals and politicians who may replace it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Noll noted that the government's high-pressure approach would only increase people's anger at the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ali, a businessman and actor now in exile in Spain who is an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month that benefited from government corruption and triggered a wave of small demonstrations in different cities last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ali said his company, Amtrak General Contracts, does not have to go through the legal tender process, to get lucrative contracts, stressing that the military and Sisi's relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi, are corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was deeply repentant of his involvement.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ali claimed that his help with the magnificent palace and luxury hotel in Sevigny was in stark contrast to the current abject life of Egyptians, and that the other side had not yet paid.</seg>
<seg id="24">On Twitter, topics such as "Come forward you are not alone", "Sesi you are done", "Sesi must roll", "next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushback, calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand that Sisi step down.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hollywood Egyptian male star Amawik has nearly 7 million followers.</seg>
<seg id="26">He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: "Sisi is doomed... He is finished, the people who support him are going to make a big mistake now."</seg>

<seg id="3">Both projects occupy the high point of each field of transmission technology in the world at present, and will improve the optimization configuration of energy in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Bureau, said the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is the largest transmission capacity in the world and the furthest transmission distance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its transportation is of great significance to promote the development of energy base in Xinjiang and guarantee the power supply in East China.</seg>
<seg id="6">GIL, the gas-insulated metal closed transmission line.</seg>
<seg id="7">The SuTong Pipe Gallery project has set the record of the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity in the world of GIL, and realized the operation of the 'AC double ring' with the highest voltage level of the core power network in East China.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the National Grid Company, the transmission distance of the quasi-east to southern Anhui project is  km long.</seg>
<seg id="9">With conventional technology, more than 15% of the electricity will be lost along the way, and the project has been developed and developed to greatly increase the distance of economic transmission to more than 3,000 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the project is put into operation, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes. It can help to solve the problem of the existing new energy in Xinjiang.</seg>

<seg id="6">Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Institute of Business Management, said trade frictions between China and the United States continued and Taiwanese businessmen faced "uncertain times."</seg>
<seg id="7">He believes that Taiwan businessmen need to move with the times and follow the mainstream industries that are developing on the mainland, especially focusing on innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"In the past, Taiwan businessmen valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."</seg>
<seg id="9">Chen Mingzhang believes that the above conditions are not enough at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="10">He pointed out that Taiwanese enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and attach importance to extending services and living products services.</seg>

<seg id="2">Social capital to acquire rural land management rights needs to be qualified</seg>
<seg id="3">The Measures on the Transfer Management of Rural Land Rights Open for Consultation on the Administration of Land Management for the Transfer of Social Capital to Industrial and Commercial Enterprises</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the "Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management (Draft Amendment)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft Opinion") for public comment, adding to the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to land management rights.</seg>
<seg id="5">The draft opinion is now open to the community for comment.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of rural land system, implement the "three-power division" system, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures on the Transfer Management of Rural Land Contracts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the first published draft of the opinion has a number of important changes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly revised Rural Land Contracting Act defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three rights division", sets up the "land contract management right" and "land management right" respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, swap and transfer of land rights (rent, transfer, stock or other means).</seg>
<seg id="9">In this draft of the opinion, in order to carry out the concept of "three rights division", we effectively respond to the tenor of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and take into account the differences between the transfer of land rights and the exchange of land contracting rights and the transfer of land contracts in the parties, procedures and supervision. Modified as the "rural land management right transfer management method."</seg>
<seg id="10">The transfer and swap of the land contract management rights will be separately introduced to regulate the management methods.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the context of "three rights division," farmers enter stocks only for a certain period of land rights, according to the Opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">In theory, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only have the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is no longer necessary to return the contracted land to the original contractor legally and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aiming at the problem of preventing the risk of losing land to farmers, the practice has produced the preferred stock, the first rent stock, the buyback and so on.</seg>
<seg id="14">Considering that the preferred stock has a mature theoretical discussion on the company law, it is suggested that it should be used as an advocate to prevent the risk of falling into the stock.</seg>
