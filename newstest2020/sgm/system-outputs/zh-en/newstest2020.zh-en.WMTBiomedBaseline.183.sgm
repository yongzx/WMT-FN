<seg id="1">The female platoon is expected to guard the coronal World Cup ahead of schedule!</seg>
<seg id="2">On 27 July, in a competition against the Dutch women of the RUF, the Chinese team was pulled back to the town with two wins, culminating in the winning of nine wins in the Netherlands at 3: 1.</seg>
<seg id="3">The programme of the World Cup was nearing its end and, while the corner was on the horizon, Chinese women continued to be comfortable in the face of the Serbian team.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the first two places of the competition with the Netherlands, Chinese women outperformed as strongly as ever, leaving two cities at 25: 19 and 25: 16, respectively, until the third place, where the workforce suffered setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dutch women, who were lagging behind, had become more aggressive, and the Chinese team had been hit and the girls had attacked their heart, and the mistakes had begun to increase and had eventually been shaken by 21: 25.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the interview, the latter also stated: "The third place, because we sent approximately 8 minutes as a result of the error."</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the strength of the Dutch women cannot be overemphasized, as is the difficult preparation before the Chinese women's race, which, although lost, is still in the hands of the groom, "and the winning.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the fourth place, the team members were active in adjusting their status, and Zhang Yongsin was at the end of the offensive, with eight minutes on the side to win for the balloon.</seg>
<seg id="9">To date, only two rounds of the 11 round of confrontation have been left, and while one of the Chinese women's squads has touched the championary cup, the key clock in the competition against the RUF is.</seg>
<seg id="10">In another competition on 27 days, Russian and American women were full of five places, and the United States team was unable to take three points from their adversaries, so that Chinese women could take three out of the march in Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Various developments were taking place in favour of Chinese women.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, while the six main elements of the Serbian brigade are well known, this does not mean that they will send three thirds easily to the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, in the form of the current build-up, the Serbian brigade has largely no billboards, which means that they can "pick up light" in competitions against Chinese women and put up the burden to shock.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the replacement Serbian brigade was not a scapegoat, which had been overshadowed by five battles with the Dutch army and the final 3: 2 Serbian squad, which had reversed the Netherlands's overall.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prior to the opening of the third phase of the competition, Mr. Laing also stated that neither team was well prepared: "The Osaka competition will be very difficult and we will be prepared as carefully as we have done in the past."</seg>
<seg id="16">The corner corner of the coronal corner has now blown up, and the competition has actually entered the "pyrolysis phase."</seg>
<seg id="17">The argument is that Chinese women are at the hands of each other, but only at the last critical juncture, depending on whether the girls are able to perform their normal level and to release themselves at the playing field as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2">On 27 July, a garbage classification education course was held in a kindergarten in the city of Gilin, Jilin province, to teach young children to identify recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was reported that this was the first time that the waste classification entered the local early childhood education classroom.</seg>
<seg id="4">The work programme on promoting the classification and disposal of municipal waste at the local level in the province of Jilin was recently launched jointly by nine departments in the province of Jilin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2019, on the basis of a pilot project on the compulsory classification of household waste in the city of Long Spring, the province decided to undertake work on the classification of household litter in local municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city of Jilin is one of these.</seg>
<seg id="7">Through this event, we hope to achieve a child-led family, kindergarten-led society and promote the concept of environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="8">The event was moderated by Mr. Liu Rice, Executive Director of the Pontifical International kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the same day, the head of the campus read out an environmental initiative in the hope that the classification of garbage would begin with the child.</seg>
<seg id="10">After performing the "Low Carbon Bebe" dance, the children were divided into small games for the classification of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instructors have also issued "recyclable" "other garbage" labels, recommending that children return home and stick the label to the garbage drums and record small videos.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Liu reported that the kindergarten had been promoting low-carbon, green-friendly ideas, with regular environmental lectures.</seg>
<seg id="13">Waste dumps have also been set up at the garbage dumps on the campus, indicating the type of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="14">Teachers teach children what can be recycled scavengers</seg>
<seg id="15">According to preliminary statistics, urban waste generation in the province of Gilin in 2018 amounted to approximately 546.52 million tons, all of which were disposed of at the disposal site.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of these, 329.29 million tons of sanitary landfills, 209.23 million tonnes of incineration and 80.01 million tonnes of integrated use processes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Death of Chirac Permanent political heritage</seg>
<seg id="2">At the local time, on 26 June, former President Chirac of France passed away at the age of 86.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of unprecedented change, the many political legacy left by this French statesman when he took office that year remains to be commended.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chirac served as President of France for 12 years in an extremely personal charismatic manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">He inherited the spirit of the independence and independence of Dalits, as well as his strong support for European integration, and was a representative of the "European dream."</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he strongly advocated a multipolar and multilateralism in the world, a statesman with a strategic vision.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is why the French media evaluated him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage."</seg>
<seg id="8">One of the Oxfam Shirak's political assertions is against the United States-led war on Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, came under the pressure of the United States and was in the vanguard of the war.</seg>
<seg id="10">One year after the outbreak of war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an intensification of terror and make the world more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="11">Subsequent facts prove that the Chirac warning was correct.</seg>
<seg id="12">The strategic thinking and choice of international political and global affairs in Chirac is undoubtedly very instructive in the face of the dilemma of European integration and the ever-heightened unilateralism of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chirac is also a French politician with great familiarity and fraternity among Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was one of the advocates and creators of the Gold Decade of Chinese-French Relations and, following his first election to the French presidency in 1995, promoted the rapid development of the Chinese-French relationship with the strategic vision of politicians.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2004, China-France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and Chinese-French bilateral engagement entered an entirely new phase.</seg>

<seg id="2">A co-statement was issued on 27 July by a part of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, expressing strong opposition to the adoption of the Human Rights and Democracy in Hong Kong Act 2019 by the Foreign Boards of the United States Congress.</seg>
<seg id="3">This statement, co-sponsored by 40 constituents, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently vested in the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law, including the maintenance of free trade ports and separate customs zones in the economic, financial, shipping, trade, tourism.</seg>
<seg id="4">These rights are not delegated by any foreign Government or legislature.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hong Kong has always been in strict compliance with international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaging in business with different countries and regions and engaging in cooperation in a wide range of related fields, with remarkable success.</seg>
<seg id="6">The statement stated that the adoption of the bill by the Foreign Boards of the United States Chamber of Deputies was not necessary, but merely in response to the call of its pilots as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs.</seg>
<seg id="7">The formed parliamentarians expressed their deep regret and strong opposition to this action by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hong Kong's good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good choice for businessmen in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">By adopting the bill, the United States would, in addition to fighting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, further aggravate relations between China and the United States, without any benefit, to the detriment of others.</seg>
<seg id="11">The statement stated that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the rights and fulfil its obligations under the Basic Law through the implementation of the "one country, two systems" approach, as it has done in the past and unswervingly.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to the European Times 26 days, reform of immigration policy will be discussed next week in both chambers of the French Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="2">The President of France, Markronon, has recently stated that France is not in a position to "accommodate all," but at the same time is trying to "properly accommodate."</seg>
<seg id="3">According to reports, Makeron tried to find a compromise path on immigration matters to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his recent interview during the general debate of the General Assembly in New York, the United States of America, Maxon expressed the hope that there would be a genuine "two-pronged" approach to migration policy that would strike a balance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Makeron said: "If France wants to be properly admitted (migrants), it will not be able to accommodate all."</seg>
<seg id="6">Makeron cited four priorities of migration policy: Granting asylum status as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; promoting more efficient integration of migrants; hosting and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of people who did not.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether illegal migrants should be protected by the "National Medical Assistance" (AME) system was the topic most discussed in previous circles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Makeron stated that he hoped that the system would be "assessed," but that it would not be eliminated, but would be subject to certain restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this statement by Markronon, the leader of the extreme right-wing "national union," in Le Ponte, argued that the Marclon's posture was "empty talk."</seg>
<seg id="10">Members of the right-wing Republican party, the President of the Senate, Rachel, also expressed the view that immigration policies should be discussed in a "relaxed" but "realistic-to-face" manner, indirectly criticizing.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Wallo, member of the left-wing Social Party, France should "receive more and better" on migration issues and criticize Marcronon for the "mockery" of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was reported that a new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which had been in place for one year, had led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time had failed to reassure the right opposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy would again be the focus of extreme right-wing attacks, and Markronon would need to make a difference on the issue, but it would also run the risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is reported that migration policy will be debated in the lower house of the French National Assembly on 30 September and in the Senate on 2 October.</seg>

<seg id="3">In response, the Chairman of the Shanghai Mercel Information Consulting Limited, Cheang Yang, stated that the overall valuation of the A market this year was low and that repurchase of shares at relatively low prices favoured greater market efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, a well-developed stock buy-back system has also facilitated active equity buy-back by listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing regulations for the repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing well-documented stock buy-back norms and guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, according to media statistics, listed companies that have implemented increased buy-back schemes since this year have been concentrated in the infrastructure industry, the real estate industry, the information technology industry and the electronics manufacturing industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have rebought more than $1 billion this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of these, the first is the Illy equities, which repurchase more than 5 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="9">What would be the impact on the market of stock repurchase by listed companies?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Vice-President of the China People's University School of Finance and Finance, Zhao Si, in interviews with New China Press journalists, stated that repurchase showed that listed companies had a stronger economic strength and better financial position, and</seg>
<seg id="11">The former is based on good corporate business performance, while the latter requires higher qualifications for listed companies and their shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="12">For capital markets, this is the most central underlying element.</seg>
<seg id="13">The repurchase of stocks by listed companies serves to bolster investor confidence and supports the stock prices of listed companies.</seg>

<seg id="5">Menu farmers have a menu tradition and lessons from it.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early 1980s, longevity farmers bought their vegetables but did not sell them in the ground.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Queenburi study found that the key to grabbing vegetables was good circulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The longline pioneered the wholesale market for vegetables and opened the door to the development of a market economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The party cadres were to take the lead, strapped, and all the losses were incurred in the districts.</seg>

<seg id="8">China and Africa stand together, not just with four votes, but with others to follow, influence and shape the Council's agenda.</seg>

<seg id="1">(A) Do Trundo "collapsed," and could he succeed in his re-election?</seg>
<seg id="2">This time, the "mass graves," which have plunged Trondo, were exhumed at one point by Trondo itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">In recent days, the Canadian media have repeatedly exposed the old photograph of the current Prime Minister, Trudo, which portrayed himself as black.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, leading to a dramatic wave of discrimination in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following the incident, Trondo repeatedly apologized to the public.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the Canadian population has not been able to buy money.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tharundo stoned his feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the political commentator Lelley et al. pointed out, since the rise of the anti-Black Facebook movement from the United States, Tirdo and FLP have been highly accusing opposition parties or dissidents. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Simply put, this time Trondo was dragged out of a "mass grave," which was exhumed at one point by Trondo itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trondo, a son of Canada's former Prime Minister, Pierre Trudo, a young elite who came out with a cyclone of "political episodes."</seg>
<seg id="11">He was a "political figure" and, after taking over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, broke out an unexpected bleak battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections in 2015 -- the Federal Liberal Party won half.</seg>
<seg id="12">At that time, Trudo presented a number of deafness platforms, ideas and concepts, such as "ethnicity and gender" and "ecologically friendly" economic revitalization, "emphasizing the eradication of corruption and" bad winds. "</seg>
<seg id="13">However, for five years in office, he had been "running down" in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of "ethnicity and gender equality," aside from this "dark face" incident, he "hailed and did not reach out" on a series of Aboriginal issues, which led to the arrival of Native groups in Canada</seg>
<seg id="15">With regard to the eradication of corruption, at the end of last year, Trondo was involved in the "Randanin incident" in boiling boiling.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was exposed to a serious abuse by the construction engineering company of its home town, Lamanin, which pressured the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation to "raise the profile."</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, as a result of the rivalry, Trudoo moved to the disclosing official, Quetti, as mentioned earlier, to the post of Attorney General of Canada when he took the lead in disclosing the abuse.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the case itself has doubts, it is difficult for its suspects to wash up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many observers pointed out that the collapse of the five years of Trondo's administration was mainly the result of its "park crater," while the largest "crater" was "self-starter," and "</seg>
<seg id="20">Canada's most authoritative Angus-Rede poll data show that, since 2015, the number of respondents supporting Toronto has fallen from over 60 per cent to over 30 per cent, while the number of opponents has risen from less.</seg>
<seg id="21">Despite the same poor performance of other opposition parties and their leaders, even a significant proportion of those who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party now do not think about the Federal Prime Minister and the head of the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trondo be able to reinvent the theatre that won five years ago?</seg>
<seg id="23">The answer may be one word: Difficulty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Both at the level of enterprise competition, at the level of consumer experience and in terms of regional aviation integration, the desire to develop the integration dimension has far-reaching implications and positive implications.</seg>
<seg id="2">On 25 September, Beijing Barrier International Airport was officially navigated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Journalists from Nunjing learned from the Beijing City Commission that the capital airport was in a state of unsaturated operation and that the opening of the major emerging international airport would enhance the capital's air service capacity.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our capital city, with Shanghai Rainbow International Airport providing mainly domestic aviation services, Podong Airport, which is based on international shipping services, with the capital airport being different.</seg>
<seg id="5">The movement of large and emerging airports has a more beneficial impact on the capital airport from the point of view of operational development.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the capital airport exceeded 100 million passengers by 2018, the highest number in the country, there are still significant operational gaps compared to fast-growing operational requirements, in particular a large gap in international air traffic requirements.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., and to adapt to the growing trend towards open and internationally connected cities in Beijing, JICA has been positioned as a major international hub, with a projected annual passenger traffic. 100 million tons</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, there is no overlap in the positioning of the two airports, targeting different client groups and having sufficient market space.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the economy account level, it is clear that the navigation of major emerging international airports will have a win-win effect, easing tensions in Beijing's air traffic, accelerating the growth of passenger and cargo traffic and creating an increased eggs.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the user's point of view, with the passage of major international airports, the future will not have to be concentrated at the capital airport, but will also reduce the range of problems associated with overly centralized routes, such as longer terminal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on media estimates of multiple traffic times and costs to large international airports, such as shuttle from the southern Peninsula to high speed on high-speed airports, 50 minutes for motorcades and around $40 for oil</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, there are a wide range of transport options available to residents at major airports, and costs and time are within a more reasonable range.</seg>
<seg id="13">From a trend point of view: Greater Airport is positioned as a Ganxing transport hub, with a small distance from the Beijing metropolitan area, but with enhanced exposure to the northern and Tianjin regions.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the future, Northern and Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from additional international airline services provided at JICA, as can be seen in the planning of traffic at major emerging airports.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concomitant transport facilities at major airports are very well developed and, in addition to the new airport lines, which are directly located in the Beijing metropolitan area, there are a number of highway links to and surrounding airports.</seg>
<seg id="16">As is the case for urban passengers in Hiroshima, Buddhism and Far East to White Yun airport in Guangzhou through the Hiroshima highway, high-speed airfields will also benefit from.</seg>
<seg id="17">It can be seen that the navigation of major emerging international airports is not just an increase in the number of runways and the number of aircraft, whether from the level of business competition, consumer experience or regional aviation integration, but also a far-reaching.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, for the navigation of major emerging airports, we need to account economically not only for individual petty accounts, but also for overall development.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nguyen Den, Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, revealed that economic and social development in Viet Nam began this year with many new developments and continued to grow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by 2019 and 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on four themes, namely economic development in 2019 and the impact of part of the ATA, salient issues in Viet Nam's economy in 2019, prominent issues in Vietnamese culture.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased in the first months of 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trade frictions among major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70 per cent of the global economy stagnating in growth, Viet Nam's economic development had achieved many promising achievements, with macroeconomic stability, inflation effectively controlled.</seg>
<seg id="8">While GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, it remained high compared to the same period in the 2011-2017 period.</seg>
<seg id="9">In anticipation of economic development trends in Viet Nam in 2019-2020, Dunder, Deputy Director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Projections, stated that Viet Nam's economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="10">Viet Nam's macroeconomic stability is expected to remain generally stable by 2020, the implementation of the self-trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and improved business environment, and foreign export activity will decline as a result of trade friction.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, to explore opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.</seg>

<seg id="2">If the 2009 Local Website Forum were to be used as a starting point, the 2019 Clouds Conference, held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 July, had gone through a full decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the concept of "clouds" to the practice of "upper clouds," big data, cloud computing have emerged over the past 10 years as one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a new energy photovoltaic cell workshop in Zhejiang Hinin, a new "colleague" with the artificial intelligence of Ariyun was recently added to the body of the quality examiner.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is available 24 hours, is more than twice as fast as manual and has a steady rate of quality check accuracy of over 95 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the head of the company, the "quality inspector," with cameras, had concentrated on more than 40,000 defective samples and had been able to quickly convert infrared images into secondary languages by using the cloud computing.</seg>
<seg id="7">This enterprise is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing enabling manufacturing transformation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatics issued a Guide to Enhance Corporate Clouds Implementation (2018-2020), proposing a significant increase in corporate awareness and motivation by 2020, with a significant increase in cloud.</seg>
<seg id="9">The founder of Ariyun argued that, today, data-centred cloud computing has created a bridge between data and the digital economy, which is a key element.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The White Paper on cloud computing development (2019), published by the Chinese Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, shows that the overall market size of cloud computing in China in 2018 was 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to being a key technology underpinning industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly transformed urban management and social life.</seg>
<seg id="13">At this year's cloud congress, the bright "city dignitaries" for the third consecutive year continues to be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the Ariyun side, urban brain has now emerged as a hub for urban management from transport governance, and collaborative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through visual insight, artificial smart algorithms, urban brain is able to achieve new urban management service functions such as "Past Pay" and "Tourline design" in real time through strong computing capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the area of government services, the combination of "one-way cloud" and "one-size-fits-all" has facilitated both sides of the supply of government services.</seg>
<seg id="17">Currently, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through the Government clouds.</seg>
<seg id="18">As at 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, aggregating 3066 categories of 190.8 billion data.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average monthly transfer and sharing of data between the Government of Zhejiang has reached 12 million, and the movement of data in "clouds" on more than one occasion may mean that the crowd does little leg.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to CBS, a recent Canadian study recently found that a plastic tea package could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to reports, researchers at the University of Margir in Canada found that plastic tea was immersed into a glass of almost cooked hot water (95 degrees Celsius) and that tea would release.</seg>
<seg id="4">This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to research published earlier in 2019, people generally eat at least 50,000 plastic particles per year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study is known to be published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packages at Monteret shop and café, opened tea bag and almost boiling.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study, they found that more than 11.6 billion plastic particles were released from a single tea bag, "several steps higher than the plastic load of other previous foods."</seg>
<seg id="8">It has been reported that most of the tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many of the tea plates made of natural fibre are still sealed with plastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some brand tea bags are no longer paper-based and turn to plastics, which are the subject of testing by researchers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plastic particles are small fragments of plastics, which are defined by researchers as ranging from 100 nm to 5 centimetres, mainly from plastic waste decomposition.</seg>
<seg id="11">Researchers have found plastic particulate traces in air, soil, rivers and the most deep-sea trenches around the world, which can also be found in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples in several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">To test the potential toxicity of tea particles from plastic particles, the Canadian research team placed Daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected their behaviour and exposed them to developmental malformations.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humanity.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers assume that these tea packages release large quantities of plastic particulates, possibly because they are exposed to boiling water, even when "food grade" plastics are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, they may dissipate or leach.</seg>

<seg id="15">The report warns that without substantial investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="3">This was made following meetings with representatives of private banks in India, non-banking financial institutions and housing banks, among others.</seg>
<seg id="4">Setalman did not explain the targeted nature of these statements.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of the previous Indian and overseas media attributed the continued slowdown in India's economy to the liquidity constraints of non-banking financial institutions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fall in the sale of cars in Setalman, for example, negated the fact that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.</seg>
<seg id="7">Setalman noted that the decline in the sale of cars was mainly due to cyclical factors.</seg>
<seg id="8">Setalman predicts that India's economic growth is likely to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by festival consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">The annual purchase season in India began in September and will continue until the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The market anticipates that buying consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.</seg>

<seg id="1">"There are some sites where overage farmers are estimated to have accounted for more than half.</seg>
<seg id="2">What is the time to find young workers?</seg>
<seg id="3">There is no way to use so many "old people" on the site. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Recently, Zou Kyi, a long-term contractor working in the construction industry, has lamented the existence of a large number of overage farmer workers (over retirement age) on the site.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the recent past, a number of farmer labourers have appeared on the campus as a result of the rainwater drainage work carried out at the university where the notaries are located, and if they are watched.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fortified farmers do not work "idle," but because they are "idle," "obliged" to continue, "whether they have money to help their own old-age and medical problems, or to help them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The "old age" of over-age farmers is not as easy as we imagine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Breadwinners, breadwinners, children attending school, helping children to buy their houses, help their children to start their homes and raise their grandchildren in isolation, when these farmers have lost much of their wealth and have lost money.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order not to drag on their children, but also to build up some wealth for themselves, a number of farmer labourers have insisted on "doing business until it remains."</seg>
<seg id="10">Many "after 80" 90 "and" after 1,000 "new generation of farmer workers are reluctant to engage in hard-working, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, creating opportunities for structural" labour attractiveness, "</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to a lack of skilled labour and a decline in physical and labour capacity, many overage farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, risky and less secure jobs.</seg>
<seg id="12">One day we can earn more than one day, and the plight of the older peasant workers behind the "idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Addressing the challenges of unpaid and unpaid work, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour incomes and improving the survival of older peasant workers, in addition to their "self-help," is equally dependent on the public sector system.</seg>
<seg id="14">It has been pointed out that over-age farmer workers are less likely to rely on home-based solutions to their old-age and medical problems, and they have to support their families by other means.</seg>
<seg id="15">The unwillingness and strength to read and understand the "idle" of over-age farmer workers helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-age farmer workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Seeing the shadow of over-age farmers, listening to their lament, finding ways to make them truly "productive" in rural areas requires shared responsibility among the public sector, the market and society and a combination of efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mr. Pimensov said that Russia would not export such a system in the next five years, because "export production will take place only after the supply of its own military forces."</seg>
<seg id="2">This approach is fully in line with international practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">Major producers of arms and military equipment always first ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier, General Yuri Guellev, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Forces, indicated that the development of the system was about to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The S-500 system was developed by the "diamond-Antai" Sky Defence Contan.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a new generation of air defence systems, using the working doctrine used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The primary role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles below a range of 3,500 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furthermore, according to some information, S-500 could also destroy high-speed cruise missiles, as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed missiles greater than 5 times sound, or even targets in near space.</seg>
<seg id="9">Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from the point of view of national defence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sergei Pimensov expressed particular concern about S-400.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that the system was currently in great demand in the world, but that it was also needed by Russian troops, including in the Arctic region.</seg>
<seg id="12">S-400 Active Arctic Air Defence Corps.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to information received on 15 September, the conversion of the New Terre Arctic Air Defence Corps into a S-400 anti-aircraft missile system has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic region.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to UNIS, "with the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, there has been a marked increase in the controlled airspace of the Arctic region."</seg>
<seg id="17">Most importantly, the use of the system in the Arctic and Arctic regions has been assessed by the military as successful.</seg>
<seg id="18">The air defence force officers have been trained in the new system and prepared to enter combat duty.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was previously equipped with a S-300 long-range air defence system and is still in part.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the case of air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying various air targets, be they outer high-altitude flights or "leaks" near protected installations.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to public sources, the S-400 "Cyclone" (Triumph) system developed by the "gold diamond-Antai air defence system is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed weapons</seg>
<seg id="22">The weapon can strike an aerodynamic target within a range of 400 km and strike at a ballistic target of 4.8 km per second within a distance of 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the security of the airspace of the northern sea.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, the first 12 "Tor" - M2DT "anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen air defence systems in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="25">At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence had indicated that the Arctic "Tole" forces would be extended in the future to complete brigade formations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Together with the new S-400 remote systems deployed on New Terre and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range systems deployed in the polar north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons provide powerful defence against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="27">Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drones will be difficult to break through this defence.</seg>

<seg id="2">The White Paper "China and the World in a New Age," issued on 27 July, answered that China's development had been successful over the past 70 years, essentially because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">China follows its own path of development, the choice of history and the choice of its people.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an environment of weakness and internal anxiety, a generation of whistle-blowers has sought and followed up in search of a way to rescue the people of the country in recent generations.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, "the constitutional monarchy, the return of imperialism, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system and the presidential system have been conceived, tested and the results have not worked."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was only with the existence of the Communist Party of China and with a new China that, in practice, the Chinese people gradually developed a socialist path of Chinese identity.</seg>
<seg id="7">This path taken by China is the path of happiness of the Chinese people, the renaissance of the Chinese nation and the path of China's common development with the nations of the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was on the right path that China could do its things well if it became the world's second largest economy with the greatest contribution to global economic growth in order to continue to benefit the world through its own development.</seg>
<seg id="9">As noted in the White Paper, China's path to development, consistent with China's national circumstances and adapted to the demands of the times, will increasingly show brighter development prospects as the times move forward.</seg>
<seg id="10">Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; around the world, the Chinese people value it even more.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese understand the logic of North Ritchen, knowing that it is not necessarily appropriate for others, but only for themselves, to be the best.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is with the self-confidence and strategic determination of this path that China has created an impressive miracle.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the process of manoeuvring, the "end-of-history conclusion" was noise.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, the success of China's special socialist road proclaimed the end of the "end of history", the collapse of the "China collapse" and the failure of the "socialist failure."</seg>
<seg id="15">China's success has galvanized the confidence of the rich and the poor in developing countries, expanded their path towards modernization and provided lessons and lessons for countries and peoples around the world who wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence.</seg>
<seg id="16">The world is rich.</seg>
<seg id="17">China has always respected the right of every country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="18">China does not "enter" or "export" the Chinese model, but will resolutely pursue its own path, achieve its own continued development, strengthen governance exchanges with countries and make its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the Fair Work Commission (Fair Work Commission), a Foodworks supermarket owner dismissed a 66-year-old female worker through a short message because he preferred to hire a worker from an Asian background, which was "shameful."</seg>
<seg id="2">The Commission stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's editor (Jianbin Wang audio interpreter, English name Eddie), who had worked in the Wagga Wagga shop for more than 20 years, might violate "</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had "wanted to run off me," since she was not a Chinese man.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairman of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet, finding that "Mr. Wang had previously advertised a number of jobs at various Chinese Employment Forums in Australia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the job requirements listed for these positions, one refers to "first-come Asian" and the other to "preferred Asian staff."</seg>
<seg id="6">The third article states that he "favours outsiders (which is the case)."</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by letter last April and later stated that this was due to her absence and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 in the silver machine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Sams, however, said that the reasons for Mr. Wang's dismissal of Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">She has been absent for only one shift for three years, and the "missing amount" totals several Australian dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">He states that Ms. Ayton was dismissed "in fact unrelated to her conduct or her performance."</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: "It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of the advertisement issued by Mr. Wang, the real motive for her dismissal is that he is more willing to hire a worker with an Asian background.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct appears to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and / or dismissal of the applicant is unlawful. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Sams said that in view of Mr. Wang's "appalling" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it would be inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her post.</seg>
<seg id="14">He should consider the payment of compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a casual worker with a hourly salary of $26.</seg>
<seg id="15">In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the head of the Commission to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate.</seg>
<seg id="16">He submits that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said: "I believe that an unfair and biased procedure should be taken to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang" waited "the opportunity, which, in my view, would" justify "termination of employment of the applicant."</seg>
<seg id="18">"He mistakenly..." The defence completely ignored any natural justice accorded to her when dismissing the applicant and is shocked by his perverse and grossly unjust behaviour. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks was a small enterprise, "it must be frankly said that any active employer would not dissolve employees in the very unfair and perverse manner recognized in the present case."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."</seg>

<seg id="1">About 800 million people walked to China for tourism supply and demand</seg>
<seg id="2">About 800 million people will travel to the upcoming "eleventh" gold weekend!</seg>
<seg id="3">Big data from many tourism platforms show that our tourism consumption market is boom in terms of both supply and demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The national holiday tourism report projects that the number of domestic tourists on national holidays is expected to be close to 800 million this year, taking into account national holiday statistics in previous years, and that there will be more than 7.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities make reservations through the platform for products such as tours, free passage, customized tourism, local play and so on, covering 100 countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism Studies, the country received 726 million visitors during last year's national holiday, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's national holiday will not only be more innovative in terms of the number of tourists, but also in terms of increased consumption, which will become the "dominant rule" for the exodus of national holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was reported that the average cost of interdepartmental travel in the country during the national holiday was over $3,000, up from the same period last year, as tourists generally opted for better-performing products, such as high-rated hotels</seg>
<seg id="9">The data booked by the donkey Mothers Tourist Network show a similar trend, with the use of comfortable car-type and 10-person "private groups" throughout the country's longline being more popular than in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Spring and autumn tourism data show that their consumers prefer "walk-by-step" with heavy experimentation, heavy service and heterogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, the pork data show the fastest growth in subscriptions from our cities on the Four Line and below, at a rate of 30 per cent over the same period, reflecting an increase in consumption among the population.</seg>
<seg id="12">Individualization is a major feature of this year's "eleventh" gold weekend.</seg>
<seg id="13">Incidental data show that national holiday rental tickets are expected to increase by almost 60 per cent over the same period, while short journeys to the peripheral small crowd lines continue to be hot-headed; and 155 per.</seg>
<seg id="14">The sharing of joy is the main purpose of people's tourist leisure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The data show that 28 per cent of the visitors to the national holiday are relatives, 25 per cent are pairs and 23 per cent are co-tourists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also, in terms of the age of tourists, "after 80" and "after 90" accounted for more than five times the total number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is a matter of concern that, in contrast to the more rapid growth of the past gold exodus, this year's domestic downstream market has shown a "blindness."</seg>
<seg id="18">Data from the pork show a 42 per cent increase over the previous year in the number of people scheduled to visit the country during the national holiday, which outpaced the excursion.</seg>
<seg id="19">Industry analyses that, in parallel with strong demand, tourism supply-side reforms have been promoted throughout the country to provide a richer "ventilation" for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, the National Sports Directorate, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism jointly launched the "Gold Week of 11 Gold Road in 2019"; seven photo festival in Shanghai 2019, 100 cultural and tourist attractions</seg>

<seg id="1">More than 100 billion yuan of a record high -- the New Wall Network -- repurchase by listed companies in the course of the year</seg>
<seg id="2">In order to stabilize corporate prices and preserve corporate image, listed companies began buying shares frequently in the last two years, hoping, inter alia, for targeted repurchase, pooled competitive trading, to increase investor confidence through undervalued.</seg>
<seg id="3">Oriental wealth Choice data show that in 2017, the share rebought by listed companies was $7.9 billion, surging to $51 billion in 2018, and that, since 2019, the total amount of repurchase had been over $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="4">In terms of repurchase purposes, corporate repurchase shares appear to be the same as larger shareholders, but there are significant differences in implementing subjects, sources of funding, repurchase uses, equity interests themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stock buyout of the Shanghai Mercel Information Consulting Limited Inventory Supervisor, in an interview with the Stock Journal journalist, indicated that there had been a larger stock buyout in November 2018, targeting equity</seg>
<seg id="6">In January of this year, stock buyout implementation rules for listed companies were officially issued by stock exchanges, and these policies were developed to broaden the sources of financing for stock acquisition by listed companies, appropriately simplify implementation procedures and encourage improved governance arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result of the comment, stock repurchase operations were conducted by listed companies with greater applicability, simpler buy-back processes and greater incentive to repurchase shares.</seg>
<seg id="8">Repurchase of shares at a relatively low level would also facilitate greater efficiency in the use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per equity, increasing net asset returns and reducing pressure on corporate profitability indicators.</seg>
<seg id="9">The repurchase of shares by listed companies is more significant than large shareholders, reflecting the willingness of listed companies to manage the market value of their own initiative and good cash flow.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the view of Cheang, the underestimation of equity prices is a major factor in the repurchase of listed companies, whose equity prices are no longer reflective of their future development prospects and are therefore of interest to investors, but.</seg>
<seg id="11">Listed companies with large-scale repurchase have at least demonstrated their development confidence and financial strength.</seg>
<seg id="12">The growing enthusiasm for buy-back by equity companies in A has also normalized repurchase behaviour, with data indicating that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented stock repurchase this year and that leading companies in various industries have become the backward.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recent disclosures by China Ping state that companies have accumulated shares A through a centralized competitive transaction amounting to 5.59 million shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company's total equity, excluding a total amount of $5 billion (total).</seg>
<seg id="14">Dividend shares have been paid $5.792 billion for equity repurchase, and the use of repurchase shares has been adjusted in the near future, of which the planned "repurchase share" will be fully used as a secondary equity incentive</seg>
<seg id="15">The dividend stated that the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would contribute to further raising the level of returns per equity and effectively increasing the return on investment of corporate shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to a repurchase progress announcement issued by the TCLG on 25 September, TCLG accumulated 3.59 per cent of corporate shares at a total cost of $1.65 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">The TCLG Board of Directors indicated to Stock Day journalists that repurchase shares would be used for employee equity schemes, equity incentives or company bonds that could be converted to shares issued by listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="18">The TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustaining healthy development.</seg>
<seg id="19">Based on confidence in the future development of companies and the preservation of investor interests, combined with the performance of secondary markets in recent years, and taking into account factors such as company operations and financial position, companies plan to repurchase shares using self-financing.</seg>
<seg id="20">The former CHF chief economist, Yang Delon, stated that stock rebates by listed companies could be carried out on the one hand by reducing the volume of shares on the market and increasing each equity return from listed companies on;</seg>

<seg id="1">Research: The United States National Healthy Diet Index (NHI) has grown slightly, but is still challenging -- the Mid-term New Net</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the United States News Network on 27 September, a recent United States study in the United States shows that the United States Government's healthy diet index has grown moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in the case of 100 out of 100, this is not to be celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="4">United States nationals continue to face "significant challenges" in diet.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the authors of the study, Dr. Yaroman, a nutrient researcher at Tavts University, Massachusetts, stated that Americans still consume too much of the national diabetes and obesity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study was published on 24 April in the Journal of the American Medical Society.</seg>
<seg id="7">The study is based on the findings of the United States Government health survey of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">The authors write that "despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges remain."</seg>
<seg id="9">These challenges are known to include reduced intake by United States nationals of foods containing saturated fats such as diets, hot dogs, sow cattle and yellow oil.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies have found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in the daily diet has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended maximum intake of 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11">The greatest improvement in the national diet in the United States has been the reduction of sugar consumption from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the intake is still too high.</seg>
<seg id="12">The official view is that sugar-added intake in daily diets should be less than 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reasons for the decrease in sugar intake were seen by researchers as linked to a decrease in the consumption of sweet gasoline, but aromatic emphasized that sugar was often included in food, such as acid milk and tomane.</seg>
<seg id="14">There has been a small increase in the intake by American adults of foodstuffs in the fruits, nuts, barrels and other whole grain categories.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, data for 2016 show that these diets still account for less than 5 per cent of the daily diet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the intake of salt has been slightly reduced and the reduction in drinking juice has led to the intake of low-quality hydrocarbons, aromatic states that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat</seg>
<seg id="17">The study is based on a biennial personal health survey, which allows adults to recall the food they have eat in the past 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">These health surveys have been asked about this issue twice every few days since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Government's guidelines for the diet of United States residents recommend the introduction of a "healthy diet model" to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">The guide states that people should consume more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, cereals, low lipid dairy products, and fish, wasting meat, poultry meat, egg.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the study, the number of people suffering from diabetes among United States nationals almost doubled to more than 7 per cent and the prevalence of obesity increased in many years of research - about 70 per cent of American adults today overweight or obesity.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chinese railway tunnel erection of the deepest record was updated</seg>
<seg id="2">The Mid-Nusra Metropolitan Railway, 27 September (Zhou Guangzhou), worked over 1,200 daylight, broke down the tunnel at Langon 1.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tunnels of the main Railway, 34.5 km long, are located in Yunnan, and the tunnel runs from the anger River West Bank across the Hurangon Mountains and is the longest.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel runs 19 fracture belts and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covers almost all possible adverse geological and major risks to the construction of the tunnel, known as "the tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="5">The erection of wells is the most important auxiliary pit route to the tunnel in the Hurricon Mountains, with the important task of increasing the operational space for "long tunnels" and later rail.</seg>
<seg id="6">The successful excavation of borehole 1 to the end of the wells marked the construction of the formal entry-level tunnel in the Mount al-Trigon tunnel, which could be increased by four additional fields and</seg>
<seg id="7">"Where wells are erected all over the lake rock floor, the extent to which they have a deep drain is high due to the high fracture of the rock layers and the lack of access to water."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Chief Engineer of the Mid-Railway Project of the Central Railway Agency told journalists that there had been multiple landslides and landslides in the construction of the well and that experts had been invited to study.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The bottom of a well of more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres deep, with a water pressure equivalent to 700 metres deep, is highest in the borehole."</seg>
<seg id="10">The landscaping said, "One hour will drown 10 metres, almost 85 per cent of our time is spent on water treatment and 15 per cent on excavation, if water is not extracted in a timely manner."</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to overcome the geological difficulties such as vertical fencing of 1 well rock, mudslides and abundant flowers, tunnel construction uses a combination of "exploration, note, excavation" systems to reduce construction risks.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result of several improvements, borehole 1 has developed mechanized water flow lines such as excavation systems, discharge systems, suspension systems, hanging lifting systems, and has resulted in the construction of boreholes, blets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ultimately, after more than 1,200 day and night work, the erection of the wells successfully completed 762.59 metres of deep excavation.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chase Railway, which has a total length of 330 km, is an important component of the international corridor to China and Myanmar and an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "one-size-fits-all" project.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the establishment of the motorcycle, travel time to Rice will be shortened from six to two hours on the road, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the western part of the country and facilitate trade and staff friendly trade between China.</seg>

<seg id="2">The head of the "ant forest" project, Xiaodi and the user's representative, took the award from the moderator for the 2019 United Nations Cup of Earth Guards in a lively voice and an ambitious music.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Global Defender's Award, held in New York, United States, on 26 June 2019, was awarded as an incentive and action award for the "ant forest" project, which brought hundreds of millions of people into environmental action.</seg>
<seg id="4">A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its winners' list at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but those who took part in the award ceremony on that day remained touched.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with New Chinese journalists, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Emile Annien, said that "ant forests" were an exciting innovation that brought hundreds of millions of people together to understand the environmental challenges.</seg>
<seg id="6">It connects people and the environment with science and technology to enable each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a great impact.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "ant forest" was launched in August 2016 by the China ant Financial Services Group (hereinafter, ant Metals) on the Metals Platform, where users record green, online payments for low-carbon actions in their daily life.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each user breeds a virtual tree, a "ant forest" and a public good partner cultivate a real tree in a desertification area.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users had accumulated carbon reductions of 9.92 million tons, and 122 million trees had been planted in desertification areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Earth Defender Award awarded the same day, Costa Rica won the award for its national environmental efforts, and President Carlos Alvarado of Costa Rica, who came to the award, hailed the "green forests" on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Kenzo, of ant Merex, said that the Earth Defender Award was an affirmation of the "ant forest" project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Kenzo indicated that the "ant forests" have affected 500 million people over the past three years and that the goal of "ant forests" for the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low-carbon action.</seg>
<seg id="14">While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers' income from green water in Blue Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to generate income through agricultural development projects, electronic platforms, etc.</seg>
<seg id="16">The digital-technology-based public-good environmental model created by "ant forests" has also been successful in reaching out to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In June this year, the largest e-money package in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of 'ant forest' to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was reported that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and Environmental Public Interest, would plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.</seg>

<seg id="2">The United States economic "scorecard" for the second quarter of this year shows that the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States was significantly slower than in the previous quarter, influenced by a significant decline in private sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Analysts noted that economic and trade friction and the uncertainty associated with it were the main causes of the second quarter's decline in private sector investment and exports.</seg>
<seg id="4">Final revised data published 26 days by the United States Department of Commerce show an annual increase of 2 per cent in United States GDP in the second quarter, which is the same as the previous revision, but is significantly below 3.1 per cent in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The data show that growth in consumption has been a major factor underpinning the economic growth of the United States in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Private consumption expenditure, which accounted for about 70 per cent of the United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent during the current season, triggering 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, government spending on consumption and investment spurred economic growth of 0.82 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, exceeding 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter; exports fell 5.7 per cent compared to the previous quarter, and net exports lagged by 0.68.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Barry Knapp, the managing partner of Eensaid Macroeconomic Consulting in the United States, private sector investment not only failed to sustain the growth momentum of the past year, but declined significantly because of.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Knapp, under the influence of policy uncertainty, United States corporate capital expenditure is expected to remain on a downward trend in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to analysts, although consumption growth strongly buttressed the United States economy in the second quarter, there were growing indications that economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it created had affected consumer confidence and had a negative impact on United States consumption prospects.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the survey, Richard Kirtin, Professor of Economics, University of Michigan, stated earlier that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers referred spontaneously to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy.</seg>
<seg id="13">With regard to future United States economic trends, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, it was also suggested that the performance of the industrial sector and financial markets in the United States would improve if economic and trade friction were eased.</seg>
<seg id="15">The British economist's think tank, global economist Keleen Berg, predicts that the future United States economy will continue the downward trend since this year, with growth rates falling to a lower level than in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mark Zandi, Chief Economist of Moody's Analyst, predicts that the United States economy will grow by 2.3 per cent this year, assuming that economic friction will not continue to escalate, with a further slowdown.</seg>
<seg id="17">The investment manager of Patnan Investment Company, Ellen Hatten, noted that the greatest concern of enterprises at the moment was the economic and trade disputes and their associated uncertainties, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced and better.</seg>
<seg id="18">Miller-Tabak Asset Management Stock Strategy Technician Mart Merley said that economic friction remained a "primary problem" and the main reason for this year's significant volatility in United States capital markets, which would be properly addressed.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the Regulations, Nimba encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave, the first of its kind in the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">In April of this year, the Guidance on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Children under 3 years of age, issued by the Executive Office of the State Council, described the joint parenting of couples.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process of amending the Regulations in Ningsa, innovation was introduced to "encourage employers to grant joint parental leave to couples with children in compliance with the law and regulations for a period of 10 days each year for children up to three years."</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.</seg>

<seg id="12">With regard to women's right to know and to dispose of the common property of the matrimonial family, article 35 of the Regulations clearly establishes the obligation of women to inform and register their joint property and to provide strong institutional support for women defenders.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, section 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination in response to social hotspots - gender discrimination in employment - and draws on the latest experience of joint interviews to strengthen the punishment of gender discrimination offences.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to the Australian Network, following Marathon debates and several weeks of protest, the New State of Australia passed an abortion legalization bill on 26 September.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the information received, the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks and there have been serious differences within the Australian Liberal Party since the announcement of the introduction of the bill by the Independent Member of Parliament, Greenwich.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was reported that after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the New Zealand Senate passed the Abortion Act on the night of 25 days by 26 votes to 14, making it the third-longest bill to be considered by the New State Senate.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 26 a.m., after a final vote by the New Länder House of Representatives, abortion was legalized in the new Länder.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at the twenty-second week of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, to have an abortion later in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Senate passed an amendment on the night of 25 days whereby doctors can seek advice from a multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Board before performing an abortion for a woman after 22 weeks of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, amendments adopted by the Senate include the requirement for doctors to provide appropriate care for infants who are alive after termination of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was preceded by public criticism of the bill from conservative sources before the New State Governor, Bailijekre, who repeatedly intervened to secure more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Liu Cunn, Minister of Finance: 67 central banks and financial institutions have been transferred to the National Insurance Fund with a total of 860.1 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Minister of Finance, Liu Quinn 27, stated that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of part of the State Capital Enrichment Insurance Fund, totalling approximately 860.1 billion yen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Liu Qun made this statement on the same day at the deployment of the National Fund for the Transfer of Selected State Capital to Enhance Social Security, jointly organized by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The transfer of part of State capital to supplement the Social Security Fund is an important step towards reforming and improving the basic old-age insurance system. It is an immediate, long-term policy measure based on universal sharing and intergenerational equity."</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2017, the State Department issued the Programme for the Transfer of Partial State Capital to Enhance the Implementation of the Social Security Fund, which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Liu Qun, the transition to the forward period has yielded positive results.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the central level, three tranches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, with a total transfer of State capital of approximately 860.1 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions from the Ministry of Finance to carry out the functions of funders has largely been completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the local level, business transition is carried out in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of 2018, the Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces pilots were largely completed, with State capital transferred to 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to the pilot provinces, preparations for the transition period were carried out in successive provinces, laying the foundation for the next step in the implementation of the transition.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Board of Revenue, the Board of Directors, the central and local PRGF was fully rolled out in 2019</seg>
<seg id="14">The meeting held that day provided for a specific deployment for the full roll-out of the transition.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was emphasized that the transition should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the schedule, the transition is to be substantially completed by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shift to tight working hours and heavy tasks. "</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Liu Qun, the regions, departments and offices need to be well organized and well structured to ensure that the transition is completed as required; that the process is well advanced, that it is accurately understood, and that communication coordination is strengthened.</seg>

<seg id="1">State funding is transferred to the Social Security Fund - starting from the starting point of the "Enrichment of the Fund's money bag," which is designed to provide a strong backbone for old-age security.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, according to the authors, this was not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but rather a "mathematical gauge."</seg>
<seg id="3">On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Security, the National Board of Directors, the Revenue Directorate and the Board jointly published the Notice on the Full Transfer of Partial Capital to Enhance the Fund.</seg>
<seg id="4">Following the publication of the document, other ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, were able to implement it very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10 per cent of the holdings of commercial banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with two equity transfers totalling more than 115 billion yuan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the regulations, subjects such as social security foundations, as financial investors, enjoy the rights of return, disposal and access to information in State-owned shares.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its bulletin, the Chamber of Industry and Agriculture stated that the change in interest would not result in a change in the shareholder and the actual controlling person of the business.</seg>
<seg id="8">In response, the authors were of the view that a similar State equity transfer was not a simple change in the attribution of equity but could trigger a series of "hedging" for a series of effects.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first "weighted result" of the transfer of some State contributions to social security is naturally a reflection of universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.</seg>
<seg id="10">After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, especially central firms, are mostly in important sectors and fields in our economy, with a stronger and more stable overall profitability.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among them, lead firms have done much more to achieve continuous excellence.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the conversion of part of the State capital would be fully rolled out this year to complement the work of the Social Security Fund.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Ministry of Finance has subsequently indicated that it will work with the relevant departments to complete the transition of part of the State capital into social security funds, in line with the deployment of the Permanent Council of State, fully embodying intergenerational equity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The second step of the shift, the "Plus result," is to enhance the sustainability of our social security funds and further strengthen the foundations of the old-age social security system.</seg>
<seg id="15">With an ageing population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the current State funding, which is the subject of transfers, has sustained profitability and dividends to effectively replenish not only the Social Security Fund, but also.</seg>
<seg id="16">Calculations show that the contribution rate of the basic old-age insurance of the enterprise can be reduced by one percentage point for every 3.8 percentage point of State capital transferred.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third step of the shift, the "weighted result," was to add stabilizers to the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="18">The transfer of proceeds to the subjects takes the form of "dividends, futures."</seg>
<seg id="19">As a financial investor of State-owned capital, SWF does obtain equity dividends.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, SWF, as a value investor in the capital market, has a strong capital operating capability.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the case of listed assets in State capital, the Fund's participation in equity will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to a higher level of business performance and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the Fund's increased equity as an investment winner has helped to further enhance its influence in the market and to act as a "stabilizer" in the market.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it facilitates the full realization of the "value discovery" function of institutional investors and leads investors to make rational investments and value investments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Demonstrations against the President's desertion from Mount Egypt showed strong repression by the authorities</seg>
<seg id="2">The Twitter subject label and the community media are strongly advocating that Egyptian people take to the streets today and turn to President Sessi in a peaceful manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since the military coup d'état launched by the then military head in 2013, dissent has become almost invisible in Egypt, making any form of protest even more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the British "Guardian," the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo non-governmental organization, has reported that more than 19,000 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests calling for their fall last week.</seg>
<seg id="6">Allegations of corruption surrounding Sessi and his family's vandalism and shameful pursuit of public funds led to thousands of people marching to the streets on 20 June.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yesterday, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated that any attempt to destabilize the country would be resolute and untenable.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city centre in Cairo has long been overstretched, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plain clothes police were visible on the streets around Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Revolutionary Station in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="9">Al Jazeera reported that, on 25 days, the security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social workers, including professors of political science at Cairo University, prominent columns and notaries.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wrote on 24 days: "I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Sessi will cause disaster." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is in the interest of Egypt that he immediately step down."</seg>
<seg id="12">Prior to his arrest in Burkina Faso, Hosni, who had served as the former Chief of Military Staff of Egypt, had been detained as a spokesperson for the Egyptian military in Annan.</seg>
<seg id="13">Annan was arrested last year after trying to contest President Sessi.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Davoud, President of the Constitutional Party, was also detained.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is exacerbated, dissenting practices reflect the fragility and fragility of government.</seg>
<seg id="16">The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who was a leader of the President, said: "The auxiliary actions highlight the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and how fearful it is."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Because the economy has been confused by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Sessi has tried to send a clear message to the important leaders and political figures that could be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nor stated that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, high-handedness on the part of the Government would only increase the anger of the population.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the barrier of fear had been broken, he expected more people to take to the streets.</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently a businessman and activist in Spain, Ali, who had been a construction contractor for the Egyptian military, began to upload a series of films early in the month, benefiting from government corruption and detonating small-scale demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Ali, his company, Amrac General Contractors, without having to go through a legal bidding process, was able to obtain a profitable contract, emphasizing the military and the Itissa (Intissar Amer al Sisi).</seg>
<seg id="22">He was deeply aware that he had been involved.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ali claims to be a victim of a sharp contrast between the current destitution of the Egyptian people and the fact that he has not paid for it.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Twitter, themes such as "stand-by for peace," "Sessi's perfect eggs," "Sseedra" and "next Friday" call down to the street and attract tens of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are nearly 7 million followers of the extrapolation of the Egyptian masculine Amarwek in Orleyzy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wherever you come, your country is behind you.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 25 May, consular protection in the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared on the front line, and the phrase at the end of the short period resonated with a wide network of friends.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Director-General of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with New Wa journalists, stated that the short film was intended to raise public feelings of "diplomatic moderation" and give Chinese citizens hope,</seg>
<seg id="5">There is nothing to do with peace abroad, and there is a grand game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Choi indicated that the number of Chinese citizens "going out" had increased dramatically over the past 70 years, from "less than 1 million per year" before the opening of the reform to more than 100 million people per year working abroad.</seg>
<seg id="7">Statistics show that, since its eighteenth anniversary, we have organized more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer Chinese citizens abroad, safely evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approximately 500,000 cases involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens have been received and coordinated for various types of assistance.</seg>
<seg id="9">At a dangerous moment, the motherland can take you home; it is no longer a dream to come to a "walk-by-go journey."</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Mr. Choi, by the end of August, China had concluded visa-free agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, an increasing number of States have unilaterally granted entry facilities such as visa exemptions or landing visas to Chinese citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">Forty-two countries and territories, such as Thailand and Egypt, have unilaterally granted local visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 other countries and territories, such as Indonesia, have unilaterally granted exemptions to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to arrangements such as layoffs and layoffs, Chinese citizens are becoming easier and simpler to apply for visas.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">These include the conclusion with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina of 10-year valid multiple visas for travel, business, and with the United Kingdom for tourism, commerce, family visits and two-year multiple visa arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="16">A "visa one-stop shop" service was launched jointly by the United Kingdom, Belgium and France, Italy and Singapore reduced the processing time for visas to 48, 36 and 24 hours, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="17">For businessmen who regularly leave the country, an APEC business travel card with multiple entry and easy access is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Mr. Choi, holding the travel card would amount to a five-year multiple visa for 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific and would be significant for business workers, especially private entrepreneurs, to "walk out."</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, China has the highest effective stock holdings in APEC economies.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens in more countries, translate the results of diplomatic work more into pro-Chinese initiatives and continuously increase the "gold content" of Chinese passports.</seg>

<seg id="2">26. Forward-to-south, 1100 kVA direct-flow transmission and 1,000-KVA high-voltage GIL gallery works were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both of these projects are at the heights of the current world's transmission technologies, which, when delivered, will lead to a significant increase in the optimal distribution of our energy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Guo Guo Guan, General Economist of the National Energy Agency, said that quasi-east to south-east works were the world's largest transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its delivery is important for promoting the development of new frontier energy bases and securing electricity supplies in the Warsaw region.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gil, a gaseous insulation metal, closes the transmission line.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Sutton gallery project created the record of the highest global voltage and transmission capacity for the GIL project and enabled the operation of a "communications binatus" loop at the top voltage of the grid.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the National Electricity Grid Company, the distance between east and south-east of the project is 3324 km.</seg>
<seg id="9">Using conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electrical energy is being consumed in transit, and the project has undergone intensive research and development, which has significantly increased the economic transport distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="10">After delivery in the east to south-east, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every eight hours and 20 minutes to help break down the depletion of existing new energy sources in the new frontier.</seg>
<seg id="11">On full-load estimates, this line will reach between 600 and 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, meeting more than half of Shanghai's electricity supply throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Sutton GIL integrated gallery project is a control project for the ultra-pressure communication ring network across the long river.</seg>
<seg id="13">The use of conventional airborne lines across Chang requires the installation of two large iron towers exceeding 450 metres on the Jiang Jiang side, as well as a man-made island of over four football fields per iron tower.</seg>

<seg id="9">As stated in the White Paper, China's development has been a great success for over 70 years, essentially because it has found the right path of development of China's distinctive socialism and remains steadfast along that path.</seg>

<seg id="13">After 18 years of historic achievements and changes in China's development, in particular, the Chinese nation has embraced a great leap from standing, rich to strong and is closer to the great goal of national renaissance than ever before.</seg>

<seg id="3">Open consultation of the Rural Land Tenure Transfer Management Approach to regulate access to land for social capital flows, such as business enterprises</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a public comment circular on rural land tenure (revised draft for comment) (hereinafter referred to as "opinion draft"), which increased the exposure of business enterprises to social capital flows.</seg>

<seg id="7">The youth journalist in Beijing learned that there had been a number of important changes to the first publication of the Draft Views.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly amended Rural Land Contracts Act defines the transfer of land and implements the concept of "triple devolution," with separate sections on "land contracting," "land transfer," "land transfer," and "land transfer."</seg>
<seg id="9">In this opinion, the land transfer approach was changed to implement the concept of "triple devolution," effectively responding to the thrust of the Rural Land Contractors Act, taking into account the transfer of land rights and the transfer of land rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">The transfer and exchange of land contracting rights will be regulated separately.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Views state that in the context of the "triple separation," farmers have only a fixed period of land tenure.</seg>
<seg id="12">In theory, even in the event of bankruptcy, farmers were only at risk of losing their right to operate for a certain period of time, so that providing for the return of the contractor to the original contractor was not legally necessary.</seg>
<seg id="13">In response to the risk of farmers losing their land, priority units, pre-lease units, repurchase, etc., have been developed in practice.</seg>
<seg id="14">In view of the more mature theoretical exploration of the priority unit in corporate law, it is recommended that it be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of inequity.</seg>
