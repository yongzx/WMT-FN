<seg id="2">The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire trucks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fire could be stopped</seg>
<seg id="4">Residents were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.</seg>
<seg id="5">Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical plant had already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas escaped methanethiol and the environment smelled extensively of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system following an industrial accident.</seg>

<seg id="2">For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. There was no trace of the bitch for 57 days - but Carole King did not give up.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was terrible. I felt sick," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while going out to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They looked for the animal, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donner had panicked Dog</seg>
<seg id="5">Hoping Katie could still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk says," She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "" Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. A loud thunder had probably panicked the dog.</seg>
<seg id="6">With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The tears flowed"</seg>
<seg id="8">57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: a man answered and said that Katie was in his yard. By the time King got there, Katie was gone. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to the Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."</seg>

<seg id="1">Bundeswehr losses: machine guns disappear without a trace</seg>
<seg id="2">Friday September 27, 2019</seg>
<seg id="3">Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition in recent years. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "scary" extent.</seg>
<seg id="5">Guns and ammunition keep disappearing from the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has lost 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This emerges from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, about which the editorial network Germany reports.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the paper from Defense Secretary Peter Tauber's office from the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been released. The weapons and weapon parts that have still disappeared include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 gun barrels for machine guns of the MG3 type are missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "scary," said the left Bundestag MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true since hardly anything was found in the course of the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor record". Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the ammunition that had disappeared also contained the one that had been found in connection with the investigation against Franco A., a Bundeswehr officer suspected of being terrorist. "Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of having this ammunition," said Renner.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As Refinitiv's observation data showed, the tanker started to move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was specified as the destination port.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "Stena Impero" was brought up on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the sea street of Hormuz on charges of violating safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified enormously in the past months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, there have recently been losses at the electric car company.</seg>
<seg id="3">New York: Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek".</seg>
<seg id="4">The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular. The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Investors liked this: Tesla's shares closed trading with a plus of over six percent. The course has not increased so much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter, achieving its best ever.</seg>
<seg id="6">Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.</seg>

<seg id="1">Riddle solved: That is why we cannot tickle ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children resist tickling so hard, only to ask for more then.</seg>
<seg id="3">Finally, it had also been shown why just coming closer to a tickling hand triggers laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep-lying layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers the laugh when the tickling is expected.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previous research has shown that rats respond with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Laughter is suppressed during self-touch</seg>
<seg id="6">So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, in the experiments on the rats, the Berlin researchers found that laughter and the activity of the relevant area of ​​the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. The activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified during the external touch and tickling by the scientists.</seg>
<seg id="7">But if the self-touch and the touch by others happen at the same time, the laughter should also be suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebrum.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed escape behavior or stiffness. This ambivalence resembles the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial to the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday.

<seg id="1">Iran releases British tankers</seg>
<seg id="2">The UN general debate did not resolve the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After approval by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, explains shipping manager Erik Hånell. The ship left Iranian waters around noon. "It's nice that it's over," he told SVT.</seg>
<seg id="5">The State Department in London described the ship's detention as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the sea. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. Given the difficult and stressful situation, they would have behaved professionally in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">The British government suspected that the "Stena Impero" had been fixed in response to a similar incident in Gibraltar, UK: a super tanker containing oil from Iran, which was said to be destined for Syria, was put on the chain in early July. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened the consequences. The "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released in mid-August. London vehemently rejected conjectures that it was an exchange to get the "Stena Impero" free.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had increased immensely in the past few months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.</seg>
<seg id="10">The nuclear dispute between the two countries is behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States single-handedly abandoned the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which was to prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the Tehran leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter and wider agreement. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.</seg>
<seg id="12">Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign powers.</seg>

<seg id="1">India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.</seg>
<seg id="2">India would actually be predestined to be a "war profiteer". Given the punitive tariffs that American President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reschedule. Chief financial officers from Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country named India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this has more to do with the imponderables of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be made to play a more important role in the globally diverse production chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Dismissed by the warhorse in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs", America withdrew the trade benefits for 2,000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the world map of the trade wars, the friction with India is, of course, only a minor issue. America also looks at the world's largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this backdrop, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, should therefore be safe.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the problem lies elsewhere: The empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that stifled all entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state for too long. Companies can now get building permits faster. You benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for swiftly liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts.</seg>
<seg id="6">The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, a lot has changed for the better in India in the first five years. But this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even set new barriers.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the West, Modi adheres to the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. Basically, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive by foreclosing their industries are regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The top of the world was already at the finish line when heart-warming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first heat of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to sway dangerously. He was barely able to stay on his feet a good 300 meters before the finish, and he stooped unhealthily when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked him in and dragged him to the finish line for the last half of the stadium. Both of them still had enough power to stop the wristwatch that was running after the finish. As if the scene wasn't strange enough.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the mixed zone race when he caught the attention of the assembled journalists unexpectedly. He shyly evaded, didn't want to talk about his feat at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">He did so emphatically that evening - and much more intensely than he would have expected. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby go ahead at the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - a good five minutes after Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary run. In the end, it was of no use, because the Busby, which only came with a lot of help, was ultimately disqualified by the World Athletics Association.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before". However, only in training, when best times don't count.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Egypt, security measures have been intensified in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. An increased police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed and streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past few days, the police had intensified their roadside checks and partially searched pedestrians' cell phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opponents of Al-Sisi</seg>
<seg id="5">Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt in years. The Egyptian building contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in Spanish exile and started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" in central locations in the country for Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution". The man is not a "good" for most young Egyptians because he made millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are well received.</seg>
<seg id="6">The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. At first, these figures could not be independently confirmed. The government also did not confirm or comment on the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Arbitrary arrests</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'", HRW said, citing lawyers. According to her lawyers, the allegations against the detainees range from "disseminating false information" to membership in a "terrorist organization". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothes, were randomly interviewed and searched, according to HRW.</seg>
<seg id="9">HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. The government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.</seg>

<seg id="2">For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ministry could not be exempt from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry said in response to a question from the Greens in the Bundestag, which the Funke media group reported on Friday.

<seg id="5">Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that Germans send back every sixth package when ordering online. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost the company additional money, because the tax authorities rate in-kind donations like sales, which are then subject to sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greens faction leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-salable products accordingly and donate to non-profit organizations free of charge.

<seg id="2">With his emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict when he made his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="3">Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. "If things go badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for cashmere. "You should have prevented that."</seg>
<seg id="4">India and Pakistan have waged three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India withdrew the status of autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby suddenly increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Not even a bottle of water</seg>
<seg id="2">The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government is reacting hard to the current protests in Egypt. It shoots the population with live ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's takeover in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything possible to avoid a scenario like the one in the days of the Arab Spring.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And that is a problem that the el-Sisi regime cannot get to grips with, no matter how hard it is against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. The currency has lost more than half of its value since 2016, and the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is also an old one. It always becomes critical when large sections of the population have difficulty getting a bottle of water at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">TÜV tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more "show stoppers" for the capital city airport</seg>
<seg id="2">It was checked for two months whether the complex system of BER fire protection systems worked together. The operators are satisfied with the progress. But the TÜV is not yet finished at BER.</seg>
<seg id="3">After large-scale TÜV tests in the terminal of the future capital city airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said supervisory board chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control committee.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper". He assured that there were still buffers in the schedule before commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now due to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hundreds of power cable defects still need to be remedied; the TÜV wants to check this until February. "In order to create the prerequisites for the start of flight operations, intensive work must still be done to address the shortcomings," it said in a written communication.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a question of missing evidence, less of new cables. There is also no approval for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the train station under the terminal is not yet working properly. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in a fire so the smoke doesn't spread. You are going down too far. 36 motors must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fire protection problems and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have risen from two billion euros to an estimated 6.5 billion euros for opening next year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is what a special meeting of the supervisory board on October 18 should be about, as chairman Bretschneider announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will switch to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. You have put the airport finances on firm feet.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, ​​Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a press spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported on this.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over this in a "wet lease", including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter planes to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times should be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="5">As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with a Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting with the AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.</seg>
<seg id="6">A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would add 16 aircraft to its fleet in Vienna next summer. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair planes and crews to Vienna for this, also in a so-called "wet lease", which the union criticized as a circumvention to the collective agreement.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Friday, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's declaration that Lauda would have overtaken the AUA in five years replied AUA board member Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years".</seg>

<seg id="1">Study of causes of heart disease</seg>
<seg id="2">Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genome of 9,000 healthy and sick people.</seg>
<seg id="3">By analyzing the genome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.</seg>
<seg id="4">The research project is the largest of its kind in German-speaking countries, said the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kuehne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Clinic, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">Overweight, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the main influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors also determine the risk. The interplay between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic makeup of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.</seg>
<seg id="6">Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic. About 200 are added every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency and heart attacks. The data could also be used to research other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer can be made.</seg>
<seg id="8">The chairman of the Kuehne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuehne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had had an open heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bio-samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. When decoding the genome, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the UKE, a person's genome can now be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, and all 9,000 samples should be analyzed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected the following year.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially underage victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them said they were raped by their teachers," said Sabo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boys were detained on the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the proteges were detained by their teachers in "most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. Around a hundred pupils, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the information, the Koran school had existed for around ten years. Residents had warned the authorities of repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked to learn about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of ​​their children's suffering. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often deficient state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs.

<seg id="1">World football election: Further allegations after Messi and Klopp's freestyle</seg>
<seg id="2">Football "signature not valid"</seg>
<seg id="3">Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe were awarded</seg>
<seg id="4">With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa honors the best player and coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus a record.</seg>
<seg id="5">After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not rated at all - with a strange reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">Much of FIFA has proven to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. So far, however, the Fifa world footballer election has not been suspected of being messy - apart from the fact that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations who are entitled to vote often vote according to sympathy rather than objective judgment.</seg>
<seg id="7">But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he hadn't voted at all, further inconsistencies are coming to light: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly viewable voting overview.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sudan's coach was also surprised</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote was received in exactly the same way, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised allegations: "Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thanks," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in its name.</seg>
<seg id="12">From the association came the message on Friday: True, but of course it was not an intention. The completed election records were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, a statement from the association said. But the second captain Manuel Rosas actually chose. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it said in the message. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "just as it is on FIFA's official list."</seg>
<seg id="13">Fifa is now having the other cases examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the voting process was overseen externally by the consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers. That's how long Lionel Messi will remain the undisputed winner of the world football choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukraine affair: high-ranking Republicans advocate official investigation</seg>
<seg id="2">Two senior Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined". He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking any action. An impeachment procedure can lead to the presidential dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scott said he wasn't surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj over the phone to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden "for years".</seg>
<seg id="4">The Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair, and only a few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had repeatedly opposed Trump's policies, such as loosening environmental regulations and tightening immigration laws.</seg>
<seg id="5">Another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also advocated the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The correct course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of it."</seg>
<seg id="6">As governor of the US, Scott and Baker have no formal say in the Trump case, which will be decided in Congress. Your statements are therefore primarily symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also criticized the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that internal cracks are beginning to emerge among the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="7">The affair could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is no precise schedule for the impeachment process. With a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek impeachment. The decision about an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The prospects for the success of such a procedure are therefore slim. So far, no US president has been removed through an office impeachment process.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three men have been arrested in Sicily and are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="3">German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after illegally heading for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - including by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now there are new serious allegations against racquet. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy on Sea-Watch 3. The suspects were caught in a reception center in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information ourselves," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities exposed - through repeated and constant physical violence," it said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up".</seg>
<seg id="7">Italy's right-wing ex-interior minister Matteo Salvini promptly apologized to Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1">US budget dispute: again only bridge financing</seg>
<seg id="2">The new fiscal year will begin on October 1st in the United States without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed to increase spending ceilings for 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on continuing funding (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to implement the decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shutdown averted</seg>
<seg id="5">For the time being, the federal administration will be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year, which will end on Monday. This is because the Congress was unable to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the federal administration cannot therefore deduct from the 1.3 trillion for the new budget year. to 1.4 trillion. Benefit from $ expanded spending.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. But spending laws reflect Democratic priorities that have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less ready ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly capable of a majority.</seg>
<seg id="7">Opinions differ mainly on the subject of resource allocation for the area of ​​domestic security and border security. Republicans in the Senate appear to be trying to force $ 12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump's top priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over building the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had resulted in a 35-day shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="8">Opinions differ on the construction of the wall</seg>
<seg id="9">It is currently unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. An extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21 is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks. A shutdown is also not out of the question.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against the backdrop of Congress's continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time and the associated risk of shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue to finance the federal administration at the previous year's level, prevent parliamentarians from traveling and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.</seg>

<seg id="1">France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles</seg>
<seg id="2">In France, artificial insemination should in future also be available to women and lesbians living alone: ​​the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that would allow all women to use in vitro fertilization. This should significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.</seg>
<seg id="3">The submission still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social security.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still prohibited</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Assembly, on the other hand, narrowly rejected an amendment to give widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In the past, there have been cases in Germany in which women have unsuccessfully complained about the release of a deceased's sperm. The opponents of the Paris advance argued that a child thus conceived would have a "particularly difficult fate".</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast, numerous MPs from the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) from President Emmanuel Macron and MPs from the opposition had spoken out in favor of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a "double grief" would be imposed on a widow if the death of her husband also left her wish to have children unfulfilled.</seg>

<seg id="4">The discussion about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is picking up steam again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and one university of teacher education advocate compensation for business flights. As a first step, this was "urgently necessary", at the same time there had to be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, she said in her opinion. The cabinet decision originally planned for July is still on hold because the CDU has still not approved the Greens.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the FSB secret service, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time there were no injuries, it said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic food shortage. The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard says it patrols to protect its marine biological resources.</seg>
<seg id="4">30,000 squid seized</seg>
<seg id="5">During the renewed inspections, 30,000 squid were discovered on the boats and confiscated. In addition, three fishermen and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russia's fisheries agency has not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there temporarily this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorye, Georgi Martynow, has also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets that were forbidden in Russia. These would also be used to take small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the ocean, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Only 18,000 in the future: USA will lower the upper limit for asylum</seg>
<seg id="2">The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="3">The richest country in the world seals itself off from those seeking protection: As the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially believers and Iraqis who are at risk should receive asylum.</seg>
<seg id="4">The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020 in the United States, a maximum of 18,000 people will be admitted to the country, as the U.S. State Department said. In the almost past business year, the limit is still 30,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept refugees from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's predecessor, admission limits were much higher.</seg>
<seg id="6">The targeted 18,000 refugee ceiling would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980. The State Department still described the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase that is strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent president .</seg>
<seg id="7">"Responsible use" of refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help them rebuild there, Trump said. He gets a lot of support from his supporters for his tough course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.</seg>
<seg id="8">A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had declared a national emergency. It is unclear whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and current domestic political developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a possible impending impeachment process.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the State Department, the US government plans to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted because of their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who have put them at risk, such as is stated in the statement by the State Department. In contrast, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.</seg>
<seg id="10">The United States wants people from this "northern triangle" in Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the request of the Argentine judiciary, an orangutan female has been moved from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a sanctuary for great apes in the United States. "Sandra", born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the 53 kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is said to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", formerly the pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving to Florida, however, "Sandra" has to go through a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="4">After her birth, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen in Rostock before she was relocated to Buenos Aires in 1995. The animal rights activists' lawsuit for "Sandra's" fundamental rights in 2014 helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational facility to preserve biodiversity is to be built there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Due to racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus from AS Roma, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on the stadium against a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been with AS Roma since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter should never attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. The situation has not improved in Italy, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and kick them out of the stadiums," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino last weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants in the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="5">But there have also been discussions recently about the supporters of Juventus. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans from record champions Juventus Turin. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fans are connected to ongoing investigations into twelve leaders of ultra fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with a complaint last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are behind the black ticket trade. They had "militarily controlled" ticket trading for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to obtain cheaper tickets.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The crabs are coming!" With this reputation, crabbing officially started on Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on September 21, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the public relations department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2">Gaochun, which is the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. From an ecological point of view, the city has ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its residents all the conditions to get rich.</seg>
<seg id="3">The people of Gaochun started breeding crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry that has generated high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting greater agricultural efficiency and farmers' incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform of "distributing power, optimizing administration and government services" and carefully maintaining the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending ". With this, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a figurehead for intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology , for energy storage and environmental protection, from the culture and health sector as well as companies for ecological agriculture, which are leaders in the "3 + 2" area, to settle here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the creation of a national tourist zone covering all areas and tourist resorts of national importance. This involved integrating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, comprehensively improving the condition of the buildings for civic and public services, vigorously developing the "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" areas, and promoting the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.</seg>

<seg id="2">Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States has promised to end all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there could be a meeting. I said, of course, no."</seg>
<seg id="4">Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged that a meeting be held. "And America says I will lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of punitive measures that should be ended was under debate. "And they clearly said we would lift all sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Ruhani criticized this move in an unacceptable manner. Given the punitive measures in place and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York earlier this week. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks</seg>
<seg id="2">After two earthquakes shook western Turkey in a very short time, the fear of disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the Tuesday earthquake. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday that there had been almost 200 aftershocks since the previous day. This increases the fear of disaster.</seg>
<seg id="3">14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been adequately prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The latent danger is repeatedly ignored in the city itself. Badly built houses collapse every year - among other things, worn down by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="5">City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have been entered as refuge in the center have long been blocked. It wasn't until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.</seg>
<seg id="6">The epicenter of the Thursday quake was in the Sea of ​​Marmara in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of around seven kilometers, as the civil protection agency Afad announced. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="7">Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had initially been reported. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some of the students cried, as can be seen in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Sea of ​​Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.</seg>
<seg id="9">Researchers fear that a 7.1 to 7.4 magnitude earthquake could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The Thursday earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Companies draw up emergency plans, private individuals have ready-made go-bags packed with everything they need, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake is coming is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings would have suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul</seg>
<seg id="13">Many users report panic on social networks. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were broken. One user wrote that it was more violent than Tuesday's. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to official information, the time of the quake is given as 13:59 (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey reported an aftershock that was rated 4.0 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt up to Istanbul. The disaster control agency Afad also announced on Tuesday that its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions.</seg>
<seg id="16">It wasn't the only earthquake that hit the headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.</seg>
<seg id="18">Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning. It made it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later the big quake will come".</seg>
<seg id="19">There had been an incident just a few weeks ago - the quake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In addition, only a few days ago there had been a violent earthquake in Albania - 68 people were injured. The earth had shaken at Lake Constance this year too.</seg>

<seg id="2">How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Metamorphosis", the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, said Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams" who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but who is now Britain's most powerful man. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined not to be stopped by anything or anyone.</seg>
<seg id="5">McEwan was quoted as saying, "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high positions literally cause the no-deal disaster - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write ". McEwan's novel "Machines Like Me" on artificial intelligence was only published in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a tremendous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows before Kafka to describe an upside-down world," said Diogenes Verlag.</seg>

<seg id="2">The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019 one day after his bankruptcy application. Travel "could not be started due to bankruptcy law reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">This also affects bookings for the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin that have already been paid or paid in full. The company left it open as to travel starting on November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Cook in Germany was caught up in the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">Insurers now want to transfer money to hotels again</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, hotels abroad that currently still accommodate Thomas Cook holidaymakers are to receive money from Zurich insurance from this Friday. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Based on the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are neither immediately asked for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise compelled," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.</seg>
<seg id="8">The insurance company thus reacted to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their accommodations themselves. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had criticized this sharply.</seg>
<seg id="9">How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to information from Thursday, there were still 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return travel for Thomas Cook customers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and to find a future solution.</seg>
<seg id="11">The now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance will only help travelers who are currently on the move. Things look bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on vacation. The company announced late Thursday evening that all trips up to and including October 31 would be canceled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid for.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company left it open as to travel starting on November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich Insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa</seg>
<seg id="13">The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about options for reimbursement of the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims using a web form.</seg>

<seg id="5">You know, we're going to keep the law.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31.</seg>
<seg id="7">And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.</seg>
<seg id="8">And time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have around six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the most recent talks have not made a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, the date of resignation will be postponed again. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times on online networks. The building contractor and actor living in Spain calls for a "People's Revolution". Today he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass rallies with one million participants in central locations in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence was already observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed and streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. In the past few days, the police had intensified their roadside checks and partially searched pedestrians' cell phones for news and photos related to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="4">On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt in years. The security forces reacted correspondingly harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. The government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1">A call to Ukraine and everything is broken? After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with impeachment proceedings, and the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - there are weeks before a decision would be taken.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the beginning of the scandal there is supposedly a telephone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The whistleblower's allegation, which ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for national security and democracy in the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has misused the power of his office to represent another country's government for one Instrumentalizing influence on the 2020 election. He exploited Ukraine's dependency in a blackmail manner and wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.</seg>
<seg id="3">The essence of this project can also be seen in the transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj that has since been published, although it does not reproduce the full text. But the phone call on July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump and above all on his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The story starts from a public perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he told the newspaper. You'd think it was inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants Ukraine to be followed up by investigations for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could prove helpful to my government".</seg>
<seg id="5">The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, for a reason for the Russia investigation to construct the United States. However, this charge was never to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is exactly the investigation that Trump will talk to Selenskyj so prominently on the phone in July. Giuliani's and the President's version reads: Former Vice President and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine commissioner, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian Attorney General at the time, Victor Shokin. To stop the investigation he was responsible for for the gas company on which his son Hunter Biden was a member. Biden senior financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt dealings.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general go, the investigation into the gas company was complete, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also accused of profoundly corrupt conduct, and the US government was by no means the only western partner to press for his release. The Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation into the company.</seg>

<seg id="1">Warning: NEVER charge your smartphone wirelessly</seg>
<seg id="2">Practical, but harmful</seg>
<seg id="3">Inductive technology via the Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="5">Higher temperatures clog the battery</seg>
<seg id="6">Researchers warn of wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a cell phone normally using a cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even with the smartphone perfectly aligned on the charging pad. The temperature rises even higher if the cell phone is lying next to the coil. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives up electricity consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">Capacity and lifetime</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the researchers, temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of batteries. Every degree plays a role here. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, it also does not last as long overall. The lifespan is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore recommend that you always charge the smartphone via cable. Since replacing the battery in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple recently increased the cost of replacing the battery even more - for all iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="9">Practically</seg>
<seg id="10">The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cable clutter and tedious plugging. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) has become a worldwide standard, which Apple even participates in, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran appears to be ramping up uranium enrichment</seg>
<seg id="2">Iranian President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European countries show inability or unwillingness to take concrete action," Rohani said Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not deliver on their promises, he announced "further steps" away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="3">The background to this is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in return contained a promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States single-handedly stepped out of the agreement in 2018 in order to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the aggressive Middle East policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with stricter conditions and is now back on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by restarting the contracted uranium enrichment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium, or at least has prepared them for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to set up more than 300 additional centrifuges.</seg>
<seg id="5">Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani speculated. However, there would still be further talks that hopefully would provide a solution.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, which had been supported by Iran, originally claimed responsibility for the attack, but the United States considered the false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Those who make such allegations have to provide evidence," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done this in talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they just claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not launch an attack like this. Rohani has met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past few days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted before possible talks with US President Trump. He urged the Washington government to switch to a "dialogue and reason" policy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Comet from another star crosses solar system</seg>
<seg id="2">Astronomers are currently observing a comet from deep space. That only worked before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from deep space was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">The widely traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope with a diameter of 65 centimeters. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.</seg>
<seg id="5">After 1I / 'Oumuamua from 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was spotted during a flight through our solar system.</seg>
<seg id="6">2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a close-up look at an alien solar system before it disappears again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, around 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is far above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a message.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the analyzes, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as announced by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under catalog number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.</seg>
<seg id="8">The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov was already sighted on the approach. This leaves researchers with many months to study. "The object will reach maximum brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".</seg>
<seg id="9">Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object over a distance of 2 to 16 kilometers. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.</seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems. How frequent such flying visits are, however, is still difficult to estimate. A planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa could possibly intercept one of the next interstellar visitors.</seg>
<seg id="12">The agency plans to station the three-part "Comet Interceptor" spacecraft in a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it should either be waiting for an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.</seg>

<seg id="1">New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney</seg>
<seg id="2">From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the UK space agency dreams of. The US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying that this special propulsion system (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Saber), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, is intended to make this supersonic flight aimed for the 2030s possible. "This is the technology that could definitely do that," agency chief Graham Turnock told the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced".</seg>
<seg id="3">In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes around 20 hours. The Concorde was the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to have covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until it ceased operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US space agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Saber will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its website, among other things. The Saber drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "next generation of truly reusable creamer devices".</seg>

<seg id="7">At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This relates to Biden's son Hunter's previous business in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is at the forefront in the race for the 2020 presidential nomination.</seg>
<seg id="8">The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been prepared. According to legal experts from the White House, this was removed from a database provided for this purpose after the interview and was instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough record of the conversation has been published.</seg>
<seg id="9">The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was a CIA foreign intelligence officer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tipsters or spies at all.</seg>
<seg id="11">How Trump expressed himself in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, but caused outrage. The House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was concerned and complained that Trump's testimony once again undermined the government's integrity.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been ongoing in various committees for months. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new force to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The whistleblower gave us a road map for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, the chief secretary in the House of Representatives. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the chairman's resignation. Trump regularly abuses ship and had called for its withdrawal months ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign affairs sector, most of whom worked under democratic but also under Republican presidents, backed the investigation launched by the Democrats for a possible impeachment process in a statement released on Friday. If the allegations are true, it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no exact schedule for the further procedure. With a majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision about an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore slim. So far, no US president has been removed through an office impeachment process.</seg>

<seg id="1">VW works council: jobs are being "creepingly" cut</seg>
<seg id="2">The VW brand plans to further reduce production costs could have a negative impact on production in Germany and Europe. This concern concerns the car manufacturer's works council. The brand plans to cut its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Personnel costs are a key to this. The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically the following applies: A job at the car manufacturer can only be reduced if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment protection will apply until 2029.</seg>
<seg id="4">As our newspaper has now learned from the works council circles, however, jobs in production that are not actually available are "slinkingly" cut in another way - that is, bypassing the official course. In this way, vacant regular jobs would often not be filled.</seg>
<seg id="5">In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the staff to be reappointed. In the meantime, there is a shortage of staff in many places, the workload is increasing, and the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants are increasing. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "As agreed, the employment volume will be adjusted socially in line with the demographic curve".</seg>
<seg id="6">The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".</seg>
<seg id="7">There are already successes in this way: For example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper it is around 7 for the Golf 7</seg>
<seg id="8">20 hours.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in our region where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. The internal rule of thumb for Wolfsburg is that 800,000 cars have to be built there annually so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems with the changeover to the new consumption and exhaust gas test method WLTP.</seg>
<seg id="10">As production director Tostmann announced last year, one million cars should roll off the assembly line in Wolfsburg. This should make it possible to bundle the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will hand over the golf production by converting it to the location for e-car production.</seg>
<seg id="11">The SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. As a result, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, it should remain Wolfsburg's bread and butter car for the time being.</seg>

<seg id="2">Young women from Nigeria are sworn in oaths, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have to go to prison for this.</seg>
<seg id="3">Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the Nigerians willing to leave had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest at home.</seg>
<seg id="4">The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in rubber boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wages were therefore completely taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="5">The accused - four men and two women - admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work was physically and mentally difficult for the women," said judge Isabel Hoffmann when the verdict was pronounced. "Some were really disgusted".</seg>
<seg id="6">The judgments are on commercial and gang-based smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and heavy forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union Ufo has again threatened strikes.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on October 14 about industrial action in the LH group," said UFO collective board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. This also involves the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.</seg>
<seg id="4">On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labor Court. Lufthansa wanted to ascertain that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appeal. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will see things completely differently," said UFO board member Flohr.</seg>
<seg id="5">In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a union judicially reviewed. The company argues that the union has not had a board of directors authorized to represent the company for months and is therefore unable to fulfill its role as a collective bargaining partner.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was preceded by a violent leadership dispute in the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the longtime union chief Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its management, the UFO had suspended an initial vote on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.</seg>

<seg id="2">So far, Saudi Arabia has not been well known as an international tourist magnet. But that should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia plans to attract more international tourists in the future with a new visa system. The tourism commission announced that the number of international and domestic visitors would increase to 100 million per year by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.</seg>
<seg id="5">Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only issued for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visits with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes to generate more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.</seg>
<seg id="6">In mid-September, several missiles and drones struck two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production slumped, oil prices soared. It will take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.</seg>

<seg id="1">Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction</seg>
<seg id="2">In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not found on any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 are threatened. 66 would already be at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.</seg>
<seg id="3">The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "endangered", "threatened with extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened</seg>
<seg id="5">In Germany, mountain ash (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."</seg>
<seg id="6">It also looks bad for the wild horse-chestnuts. They have been considered "at risk" since stage two of the IUCN scale. The greatest threat besides a fungus is the Balkan leaf miner. It has spread from south-east Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and avenues are not included in this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shrubs and mosses are also at risk</seg>
<seg id="8">The IUCN scientists also created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. According to the IUCN, more than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs like snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important food source for birds and other animals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe office. "We need to limit human impact on our ecosystems and make protecting these species a priority."</seg>

<seg id="7">The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently dropped the number of viewers: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Even so, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">There had been turmoil in advance of the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl: According to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear in the dispute over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not very friendly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen on his knees in the 2016/17 season before the NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism.

This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African-American football stars.

<seg id="2">According to a press report, some banks may face the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook. There is a risk of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday edition.</seg>
<seg id="3">Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to £ 1.8 billion (around € 2 billion) on their books, the report said. That would have shown estimates of the consulting firm AlixPartners.</seg>
<seg id="4">Borrowers would have to put up with write-downs of £ 900m to £ 1bn and lenders between £ 550m and £ 825m. The amounts actually to be written off are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="5">How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will be shown after the bankruptcy proceedings. A person close to this process did not radiate much hope. For example, the approximately 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad locations. The most money can probably be got out by selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.</seg>

<seg id="4">British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains secret about whether he wants to push through an unregulated Brexit - despite the recent law passed by Parliament, which is exactly what should prevent it. When asked a question, Johnson only told journalists that his government would abide by the law.</seg>
<seg id="5">The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="6">Former British Prime Minister John Major said Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postponed the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit. Johnson said he was looking for a contract with the European Union.

<seg id="4">After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an exceptional pre-Instagram family, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."</seg>
<seg id="5">With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. She has made thousands of Polaroids, a few hundred of which are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".</seg>
<seg id="6">There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course there is always one focus: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.</seg>
<seg id="7">There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, talks on the phone in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears shapeless moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also lived a normal life beyond the spotlights on their farm in southern England or Scotland. So, according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she slept in a bed that her father made out of old potato boxes. And it wasn't always tidy with the McCartneys either.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment like hardly any other medium. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's about the decisive click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney." If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.</seg>
<seg id="10">The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides everything anecdotal it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are sometimes like abstract Paintings work. The perfect addition to the recently released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">The US government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. That corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">The State Department said the US remains committed to supporting refugees. But the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. The US immigration system is currently overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. government plans to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are at risk as a result of the State Department statement emerges. In contrast, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.</seg>
<seg id="5">The program, launched in 1980, selected refugees from UN camps around the world and resettled in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. The current upper limit of 30,000 is already a low. When President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aid organizations were horrified by the announced lowering of the upper limit. "It's a very sad day for America," said International Rescue Committee chief David Miliband. The United States would further damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump is strictly trying to limit immigration to the U.S., both legally and illegally. The US government says it expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.</seg>

<seg id="2">US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying on whistleblowers. Whoever has given relevant information to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power "comes close to an informer," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media report this unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this, Trump spoke to employees of the United States' UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treachery, we used to do it a little differently than we do now."</seg>
<seg id="4">Observers valued the latter comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of being intimidated by witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, wrote the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision Committees in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">The whistleblower has now complained to the president that he has abused his office to solicit interference from another country in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump encouraged him to investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be a CIA analyst.</seg>

<seg id="1">Letting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble</seg>
<seg id="2">WeWork has become the largest office tenant in New York.</seg>
<seg id="3">Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in income.</seg>
<seg id="4">The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had taken over founder Adam Neumann as its boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports, among other things, that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. This means that the largest tenant of office space in New York and London is suddenly out of the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">WeWork rents large office space on a long-term basis and rents it out to members in small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of $ 1.6 billion on sales of $ 1.8 billion. This year, rental costs alone are expected to have risen to an estimated $ 2.5 billion as a result of the leasing of new large spaces. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Financial Times, WeWork has signed leases of up to 15 years that result in commitments of more than $ 40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWorks' new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space that was newly launched during this period. Without WeWorks expansion, office vacancies in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insider". The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in prime locations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for just under EUR 100 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many landlords have remodeled their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions of dollars. Despite the long-term leases, they do not have access to WeWork's - already scarce - reserves. Because the individual WeWork locations are usually rented by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable to a limited extent.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian coast guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a further 262 poachers have been arrested who illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence agency FSB said on Friday, according to the agency Interfax.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. The border guards had previously been shot at and three of them injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic food shortage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard says it patrols to protect its marine biological resources. During the renewed inspections, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, three fishermen and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Nowosti agency, the coast guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018</seg>
<seg id="5">The Russian fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there temporarily in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorye, Georgi Martynow, has also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets that were forbidden in Russia. These would also be used to take small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the ocean, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. The ships themselves do not meet the hygienic and technical regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Moscow, three members of the Russian coast guard were injured in the arrests last week. Another North Korean who was also wounded later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first moored a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.</seg>

<seg id="2">The United States has banned former Cuban President Raul Castro and his children from entering the country. The US State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday that Castro was involved in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he headed a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="3">As head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also to blame for human rights violations there, supported by the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and the use of violence to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump had issued bans on entry against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others, on Wednesday. A bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging in Venezuela for months. The United States has imposed a number of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and to power the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaidó.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cuba is one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors.

<seg id="1">New climate protests from Fridays for Future</seg>
<seg id="2">A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again for more climate protection.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning campaigns and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. New Zealand and Australia should start because of the time difference before the protests spread across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather outside the White House in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="4">How big the worldwide response will be this Friday after last week's record participation is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. "Last Friday over four million people went on strike for the climate. We'll do it again this Friday!" She wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Germany in particular, the influx was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities like Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take the streets for the climate.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on her country's politicians to step up their efforts to protect the climate. This gave rise to the Fridays for Future movement within a short period of time. Schoolchildren and students in particular take part in climate protests, but scientists and other adults are also increasingly involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Together, they call on politicians to be more ambitious in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month after a two-week transatlantic trip with an ocean-going racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, urging the heads of state and government of the world into their consciences. In her home town of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize by the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to protecting the climate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?</seg>
<seg id="2">Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. It is all the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl, of all people, holds the mirror in front of the power people of that time. But what's behind it? Is it helpfulness or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historic feat or manipulative tactics for its own sake?</seg>
<seg id="3">On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a crowd of children and young people. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt that he was chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time he was able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently traveled to America with a sailing boat.</seg>
<seg id="4">But is there a dark side to this? Why is a stock called "We don't have time" needed to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the campaign was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money is flowing thanks to the impressive campaign.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here, opinions are divided: is it morally right to enrich yourself financially when you save the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? Regardless of the position ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may make sense to critically question apparently pious projects by certain trendsetters.</seg>

<seg id="2">An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="4">Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they are certain: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I / Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="5">2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea</seg>
<seg id="6">The body was discovered in the Crimea by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow. He looked up at the sky with a self-made telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicions. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted during the flight.</seg>
<seg id="7">The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get a glimpse of a strange solar system up close. Apparently the Comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system.</seg>
<seg id="8">Komet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months</seg>
<seg id="9">But before that happens, astronomers can watch him closely. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted on its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".</seg>
<seg id="10">The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".</seg>
<seg id="11">First findings about Komet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science</seg>
<seg id="12">According to initial findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.</seg>
<seg id="13">The observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The asteroids keep the researchers busy. Just recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother</seg>
<seg id="2">It is getting lonely around Boris Johnson. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the warlike language of the premier as "tasteless" with clear words. It is not the brother she knows.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Surrender", "fraud", contract ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm up - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons on Wednesday this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and other critics have now come to terms with each other Word reported: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="4">The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like surrender, as if the opponents of an exit from the EU should be "hanged, dragged, quartered, tarred and feathered". She thinks that is extremely reprehensible. She doesn’t recognize her brother’s version, said Rachel Johnson, who ran the Change UK anti-Brexit party in the European Parliament elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, she stumbled upon her brother's mentioning Jo Cox, an EU-friendly MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. The best way to honor their memory is to go through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a Member of Parliament who was murdered by someone who called Britain First," criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had apparently come from the extreme right-wing camp, which felt "reinforced by this type of language". For those who mourned it, it was very tasteless.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Cox widower also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to be passionate and determined about what you believe in - no matter what your view. But never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks were more likely.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and mandate as Tory MP. "I have been torn between family loyalty and national interest over the past few months - it's an indissoluble tension," said Jo Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="8">Johnson's language also met with harsh criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 Church of England bishops and archbishops criticize the language, which is "not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said: "In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak to each other with respect."</seg>

<seg id="3">Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming US Football League NFL final. The organizers announced on Thursday (local time).</seg>
<seg id="4">"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American Football League final, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shakira became known as the star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. Her worldwide breakthrough came in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".</seg>
<seg id="9">The announcement of half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the United States every time. This year, many see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least due to President Donald Trump's immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, and it is now also extremely popular in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">Political controversy arose in the past year. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against blacks, had refused to stand up when playing the national anthem and had been hard-hit by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had declined a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was ultimately criticized by many.</seg>

<seg id="1">An actor and Youtuber strikes Egypt's rulers: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2">The two men who have an impact on whether blood flows on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who deposed Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013 had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's approach to political Islam and not a syllable about human rights violations lost on the Nile - in a week in which Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest the president. "No need to worry," said Sisi at the airport into the state television microphones. "The Egyptians are not to be misled".</seg>
<seg id="3">The President believes that the other man, who is currently driving the streets, is trying to mislead him. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to step on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor to only a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice who dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: With his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets", Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.</seg>
<seg id="4">He addresses the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president wallows in luxury and has magnificent new palaces built, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he had been doing business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a building contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the virtually exploding click figures show.</seg>
<seg id="5">After last week's demonstration against his rule for the first time since Sisi's reach for power, and the arrest of nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures in civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture onto the streets. But there were occasional small protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, the participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. The police also used tear gas and rubber bullets in these protests. Initially, these videos could not be verified independently. Security circles said the police had ended the protests.</seg>
<seg id="6">A massive police presence was reported on Friday from the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", and most of the streets around Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi entrenched themselves in 2013 until the army put them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was supposed to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted a large-scale rally here, of all places hold for the president.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not run into police officers." However, this should not be understood as a withdrawal: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square".</seg>

<seg id="2">The first senior Republican, the Vermont governor has spoken out in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are found," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking any action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the President's dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj over the phone to investigate interventions by Ukraine's Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump has been watching Biden "for years".</seg>
<seg id="4">Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown unease about it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has opposed Trump's policies on several occasions, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration laws.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how it should go on with the films about Tom Holland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the surprise: After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Several US media report this unanimously. According to this, the theatrical release is already certain: In the USA, the film should start on July 16, 2021.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted in the magazine "Screenrant": "I am pleased that Spidey's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the one only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring. "</seg>
<seg id="5">But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would have a 30 percent share in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="2">After nine seasons, the "Suits" series has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy ends and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been part of the series for many years, were also given a charming tribute. Warning, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.</seg>
<seg id="3">One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return as Rachel Zane in the final for a last farewell, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some flashbacks showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. Such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage to Mike or how she greets him after his serving time in prison.</seg>
<seg id="4">But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking towards the altar to marry his fiancee Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a meaningful remark about his suit. The stunned Harvey wants to know from the groom whether he actually threw on a frock coat, only to then snap off: "Louis, you're not the Prince of England".</seg>

<seg id="2">A baby and four other children drowned while a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were saved.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hundreds of migrants are currently migrating from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to find out in Turkey "how the refugee situation is," said Seehofer on Friday. Then he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help with the coping.</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip to Seehofer on Friday with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.</seg>
<seg id="7">An unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Is the Turkey deal still working?</seg>
<seg id="9">The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This means that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the processing of asylum applications is slow due to a lack of staff on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Citizens' Protection, almost 29,400 people remain in Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation is worst in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state broadcaster reported that there have never been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Canadian Greens boss holds a reusable mug in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The mug was manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ottawa / Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally attracted attention. Elizabeth May, head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee mug with a metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this mug talking to citizens. However, the photo had previously been published and also distributed to the media - and the mug was still a crude (cardboard) mug, as the Canadian National Post reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Green leader has to answer for photo breakdown</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Post subsequently accused May of manipulation and that the party was producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons election, in which Trudeau is also having an increasingly difficult time due to a bribery scandal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The photo went viral on social media and fueled the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".</seg>
<seg id="8">May was shocked and stated on her blog that she hadn't known about this campaign. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: In conversation with citizens, she was holding a mug in her hand. However, she corrected, it was made of bamboo. You always have him with you. A spokeswoman for the party said it was only a matter of placing the party logo in the picture and not of covering up something. Only a section of the photo can be seen on the website.</seg>
<seg id="9">May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, and at the same time asked something from her over-committed team: "If you feel like editing an image again, you couldn't do anything with it make my face so that I look younger?

<seg id="2">Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng was assured an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she wasn't allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.</seg>
<seg id="3">Spontaneously upgrading to Business Class - that's what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they're lucky, and check-in staff offer a free Economy Class switch.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, this case shows how one should not do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. More than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng on Instagram. She flew from Taiwan to New York on May 30 and June 7.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the outward flight, Jaqueline's staff refused to upgrade, even though she showed an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly announced an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from an airline marketing employee. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having forged the mail.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman is said to have shown the same email, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked the head office. In fact, the employee from whom the email is said to originate is said to have denied email contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="7">The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="8">With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.</seg>
<seg id="9">But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the email, the case remains clear: the influencer has committed fraud for Cathay, she will be blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that the airline does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now hires a lawyer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Oil prices dropped more than a dollar in a very short time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $ 61.83 - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) grade fell 1.3 percent to $ 55.77.</seg>
<seg id="3">The slide in the course was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on an armistice in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.</seg>
<seg id="4">In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. An armistice would alleviate political tension in the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">If an agreement is actually reached, the company can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank at the Bloomberg news agency.</seg>
<seg id="6">Oil prices are continuing their downward trend of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost nearly $ 59, Brent almost $ 65.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bloomberg, citing insiders, recently reported that after the mid-September attack, oil plant repairs in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than expected. According to this, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day again and is moving in the direction of the original volume.</seg>
<seg id="8">Recently there have been several press releases citing insiders, which report on the rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, there were signs of some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on the way to leaving the port more than two months after being fixed by Iran and the recently granted release. The crew is now preparing to depart while the ship is still at anchor, shipping manager Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the United States announced that it would deploy anti-aircraft missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2">North Korea has raised doubts that rulers Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon hold a third summit in the nuclear dispute.

<seg id="1">Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven</seg>
<seg id="2">Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and now head of Integrity of the World Athletics Association.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details of the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only to a degree. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were faked.</seg>
<seg id="4">In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The Wada then blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes competing under the neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes took part in the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports. In summer, the World Cup was even held in Russia with the host as a participant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Positive findings are missing</seg>
<seg id="6">The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent to which state doping has been used to cover up doping cases. They should help punish athletes afterwards. They were finally delivered three months later.</seg>
<seg id="7">The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada received from a whistleblower and the data it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The World Cup was not affected</seg>
<seg id="9">This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to hold onto the spell of Russia. 30 Russian athletes start at the World Cup in Doha under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and taking tests.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier this week, the Wada had already tampered with and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatened to block Rusada again and, in the worst case, to be excluded from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</seg>
